Jack Justis<br>
<br>
Well, sometimes you do, and sometimes you get more and sometimes less.<br>
<br>
Let's do a quick study of two similar cases.<br>
<br>
The folllowing one is an original Jack Justis case made in 2006
according to the Justis signature on the bottom. &nbsp;The owner of
&nbsp;the case is a very good player from Taiwan who graciously
lent it to me for the purpose of this pictorial.<br>
<br>
Original Price: <br>
<br>
This is the case in it's original state and after two years of use.<br>

<br>
This is the "ProLite" interior that is made at the Long Chan Cue Case
factory in China. &nbsp;Notice that it doesn't fit properly.
&nbsp;I speculate that the reason it fits loosely is because the
case maker did not want to change his pattern to fit this size of tube.<br>
<br>

<br>
This interior is the exact same as that found on many models of
inexpensive cases that are also made by the Long Chan Case factory.
&nbsp;In fact, although the case maker has named it "ProLite" and
claims to have invented it in fact, fabric liners inside of plastic
shells for cue cases as been around since the 70's at least.
&nbsp;Again notice the ill fit.<br>
<br>

<br>
Here it is shown that the interior tube is easily removable.
&nbsp;The maker claims that this is a "feature". &nbsp;We think
it's an excuse to cover up a poor fit.<br>

<br>
This is the bottom of the liner as it came out of the case.
&nbsp;Notice that there is no padding whatsoever nor is the tube
sealed in any way.<br>

<br>
Now we move on to the construction of the shell and the pictures are
self-explanatory:<br>

So for $ &nbsp; you get a fairly simple exterior shell poorly
fitted over an imported plastic tube that uses the barest of protection
and was taken from inexpensive cases.<br>
<br>
Now let's compare what you get for $ &nbsp; from us:<br>
