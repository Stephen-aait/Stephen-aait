== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<h3>How Does the Plugin Work?</h3>

The plugin works based on the maximum width set in the admin panel.  If you upload an image larger than the maximum width, a crop overlay will show up on the attached image.  You can then crop the image based on your preferences in the admin panel.

If the cropped image is greater than the maximum width, then an option will show up allowing you to insert a link to the larger image.

<h3>What Happens When I Crop an Image?</h3>

The image will be cropped according to the red-box selection.  If the selection is larger than the maximum width you have selected, the image will then be resized to the maximum width.

<h3>What browsers does this plugin work for?</h3>
This plugin has been tested on Firefox 2.0, Opera 9, and IE 7.

<h3>Where can I find support for this plugin?</h3>
