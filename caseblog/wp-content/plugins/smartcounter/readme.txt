SmartCounter is a simple counter which can track downloads, clicks or hits.

== Description ==

Smart counter can be used in three ways:

1. as a download counter.
2. as a click counter.
3. as a hit counter.

Used as download counter, it displays a download button, tracks downloads of a given file and displays that number on your site if you wish.


Used as click counter, it displays your link, tracks number of clicks and displays that number on your site (if you wish).


Used as hit counter it increments every time a given page is loaded and displays the number of hits on your webpage (if you wish).


In admin panel, you can view how many times a link has been clicked, a file has been downloaded or a webpage has been loaded. You can also easily add or remove links and change the displayed messages (in your own language for example).


To change the button image simply replace it with your own .jpg. (Just rename your image to download.jpg )


Smartcounter is a very small plugin and uses only one parameter in your database.


Smartcounter can track several links at once.


Please note : smartcounter does not check if a given file or url exists or a download process has been successfully completed. It’s just a counter!
