Notice: &nbsp;We have seen counterfeit J.Flowers brand cases entering
the market. &nbsp;For more information please go to this blog post, <a href="http://jbcases.com/caseblog/2011/04/16/aint-nothing-like-the-real-thing-beware-of-counterfeit-fake-j-flowers-cases/" target="_blank">Nothing Like The Real Thing.</a></span><br><br><span style="color: red;">J.Flowers
is a trademark owned by John Barton and Sterling Gaming for the USA and
Europe, The Jiasen Company for China.&nbsp; If you are offered a case
that you cannot verify came
from one of these three sources or their authorized dealers then it is
likely a knockoff or counterfeit. &nbsp;Many people would love to
profit off off our brand names and designs. &nbsp;As a consumer you
lose whenever they can defraud you into buying a case based on your
expectation that we made it. &nbsp;Verify, then buy.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
In the USA there is no authorized distributer for this brand other than Sterling Gaming, John Barton and their dealers.</span><br><br>The easy way to tell
if a J.Flowers brand case was made in our shop is to see if there is a
serial number inside the maker's mark. &nbsp;Cases made in our shop
have&nbsp;the year of manufacture and a three digit &nbsp;number.
&nbsp;You may email us at Flowers@jbideas.com if you need to have a
serial number authenticated before purchasing. &nbsp; &nbsp;Production
cases do not have any number in the maker's mark. &nbsp;Those were made
by the Jiasen company in accordance with my specifications.<br>
                  <br>
Jiasen does make many cases that are outside the orignal western tooled
theme that defined the old J.E.F. Q Case style.&nbsp; (see below for
more information)&nbsp; These cases do have the J.Flowers brand but
they are not authorized to be sold in the USA and are not covered under
any warranty given out by John Barton or Sterling Gaming.<br></font><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br><br>Jasper
"Jay" Flowers was a pioneer in cue case business. &nbsp;He
was an inspiration to myself and many other case makers. &nbsp;Jay sold cases under the J.EF. Q Case brand. Jay
stopped selling cases in 1994 and left us in 2005. &nbsp;I have created
this line to preserve his legacy and classic style. &nbsp;I have made
upgrades and added a few modern touches while retaining Jay's basic
western saddle theme. &nbsp;In the coming year we will be adding more
patterns to emulate the variety of tooling designs that Jay was fond of
using.<br><br><img style="width: 600px; height: 186px;" alt="" src="/cases/jflowers/jayflowersfirstcase/small/DSC08573.JPG"><br>
                  <br>
This is the J.EF Q Case logo.&nbsp; Under it you can see the maker's
mark.&nbsp; For years many of us have wondered who "NH" is.&nbsp; Well
recently I received an email informing me that the logo is not NH but
instead is NVH and it's for Nora Van Horn.&nbsp; According to Nora's
grandson Michael, Nora was the actual case maker and Jay was the
marketing arm.&nbsp; I am in conversation with Michael to find out more
and see if we can't showcase Nora Van Horn more and get some background.<br>

spoke with Jay shortly before he passed away. His life had come full
circle and he went from a raging bull to a sickly, elderly man with
lung cancer. He was honored that someone wanted his story and thought
the pool world had forgotten him. At one time, he rolled with the best
of them including Buddy Hall and others. He was, at one time, a hard
guy. I would say he was even feared. Jay did a lot he wasn't proud of
in his life, but he redeemed himself through religion and his
relationship with his dedicated wife.</span><br style="color: white;"><br style="color: white;"><span style="color: white;">When
I called him, he was flattered that his name was remembered in the pool
world, that someone wanted to know about him and his story. I felt he
was on the verge of tears. I was nervous because I knew he was very
ill, but I asked at least a few decent questions. If I could go back, I
would have asked a lot more.</span><br style="color: white;"><br style="color: white;"><span style="color: white;">I
honestly think that Jay would be proud that someone, one day, would
make a case to tribute his style, and put his name on them. "</span></small><br style="color: white;"><br style="color: white;"><small><span style="color: white;">Chris</span></small><br><br>We
have modernized the basic design of the case to include a longer lower
pocket which is fairly standard on cue cases today. &nbsp;I pretty much
pioneered this size pocket on cue cases due to the invention of the
jump cue and 14" jump cue handle. &nbsp;While with Instroke I
lengthened the lower pocket to 15" and added a zippered compartment on
the side to hold a jump cue handle. &nbsp;Within a few years this
length pocket and jump cue compartment were fairly standard on most
cases sold. &nbsp;In addition I have added my signature super-protective interiors.<br><br>&nbsp;Now, on to the cases......</font></div><br><big>J.Flowers Cue Cases are available for immediate sale through Sterling Gaming and it's dealers, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cuesight.com">www.cuesight.com</a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indyq.com"><br>
