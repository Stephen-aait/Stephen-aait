This page is a work in progress.&nbsp; Since I never really
collected
all the nice things people have said I now have to go and find them and
bring them here.<br>
<br>
So here is what our customers have to say about their cases:<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><big><span
style="font-weight: bold;">My Lifetime Case</span></big><br>
<br>
<p><strong> …. I have had many leather
cases over the years – I can’t even remember them all – and was never
really happy with any of them except for a little 1×2 case made by Marc
Turcasso. Yeah, I’m pretty picky. But I recently received a 3×4 case
John built to my specs – lots of design freedom with John – and I am
extremely happy with it in all respects. It’s a relief to finally have
my “lifetime case” to go along with my 28 year old “lifetime cue”. To
those who think “built in China” means lower quality, I have no comment
except to say that it’s not true with JB Cases. </strong></p>

OTHERS WILL BE FOR STORAGE. I LIKE THE WAY YOU DESIGNED
THE&nbsp;DOUBLE&nbsp;LONG POCKET FOR ACCESSORIES AND JUMPCUE

----------------------------------------<br>
Jeff just purchased another case from us and this is what he had to say
about &nbsp;it:<br>
<br>
JOHN
YOUR SHOP PUTS OUT A GREAT CASE AND AS I'VE SAID BEFORE I BELIEVE
SECOND TO NONE AS I'VE SAID ON AZB AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE NEXT
TIME WE DO A CASE TOGETHER I'M GOING TO SEND YOU SOME PRINTS AND LET
YOU RUN WITH THE GENERAL IDEA. I HAVE ALSO BEEN THINKING ABOUT A CASE
MADE WITH PYTHON SKIN SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE SO IF YOU EVER RUN INTO A
GOOD PIECE OF THAT WE'LL HAVE TO WORK SOMETHING OUT ON THAT. SO THANK
YOU FOR THE OFFER OF KEEPING ME SATISFIED BUT YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE
THAT MORE THAN ONCE. SO AGAIN I WISH YOU AND YOURS A SAFE SUMMERS
ENDING AND AS I TOLD KAREN I WILL SEND YOU SOME PICTURES OF ME AND ALL
MY JB CASES SOON. HAVE A GREAT DAY JEFF<br>
&nbsp;<br>
PS THIS IS A TRUE
STORY LAST NIGHT I GRABBED THE CASE OUT OF THE TRUNK OF MY CORVETTE AND
CARRIED IT INTO MY HOUSE.......NOW FOR THE BEST PART WHEN I WENT TO SET
MY CASE DOWN I REALIZED I HAD PICKED THE CASE UP BY THE STRAP HOWEVER I
WAS HOLDING THE CASE UPSIDE DOWN ALL THE WAY INTO MY HOUSE FROM THE
GARAGE. JOHN I HAD MY MONSTER TASCARELLA(7K-9K) IN IT IN FACT I HAD
TAKEN IT OUT OF THE FELLINI STYLE TASCARELLA CASE YOU MADE AND BECAUSE
OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CASE MY CUE IS STILL IN PERFECT CONDITION. SO
YOU CAN TELL THAT STORY AS ITS A TRUE EXAMPLE OF THE PROTECTION YOUR
INTERIORS OFFER. WELL ENOUGH OF MY BLABBERING......<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">JB 4x8
Butterfly - 07-12-2013, 05:08 AM<br>
I have just received a JB butterfly 4x8, and thought I'd drop a few
words on it. The case is solid and appears to be very well constructed.
The attach points for straps and handles also seem to be very strong.
Being a butterfly, the case is very light. The leather has a great feel
to it, and although the design is simple, it stands out as an item that
that is obviously not mass produced. The pockets are fantastic; they
are easy to access, spacious, and the large pocket has a side
compartment with a sleeve for a jump cue. The shoulder is very
comfortable and has great padding.<br>
<br>
Perhaps most telling, is that when I had the case next to a fairly
eye-catching 'instroke', every person in the club made comments
suggesting they preferred the JB case, even at a cursory glance. And
this is in Korea, where knowledge of cases is minimal, and bling is
usually king.<br>
<br>
My only concern, and it's in no way a fault of JB Cases, is if the case
is safe enough to fly with. I often need to fly to events, and it just
didn't occur to me that a butterfly case may not have a shell that can
stand up to the luggage bay on an aircraft.<br>
<br>
By the way, in the picture of just the JB case, you can see my wallet
on the rail. It cost $1400. As I was taking these quick pictures (which
are pretty shoddy by the way, sorry John), the fact that my small
leather wallet cost just under two times the combined value of those
two striking cases made me realise that the price of a custom leather
case from someone like John is actually really freaking good value.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm very happy with the case, and it feels great hanging on my
shoulder, not just from a comfort perspective, but knowing that I have
on display a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. <br>

Flowers Tribute Case reviews<br>
</a><br>
I
had picked one of these up about a month or so ago.I can say that I am
very pleased with my purchase.It has become my everyday case.It's a
2x4.Everything fits nice and tight.I even can flip it up-side down with
the lid open and nothing falls out.I feel very safe with my cues in
it.For the money as far as protecting my cues I'm finding it hard to
believe there's anything better on the market today.I'd just like to
say TAP...TAP...JB!!Great work on a great product!:thumbup::thumbup:<br>
<br>

<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
After
being a long time It's George fan I decided that JB's Ultra Pad
interior was just calling my name for me to test out. I now own a 3x6
Flowers tribute case and I can't say enough about how happy I am with
it. The exterior of this case is very easy on the eyes. It looks very
well built with quality hardware and it seems "Heavy Duty" but is
surprisingly light in weight. Both pockets large and small have the "L"
zipper configuration and makes accessing these areas very easy. The
large pocket also has a 3rd zipper with a very nice sewn in Pocket to
hold a jump cue handle.<br>
<br>
Now the good part......This Ultra Pad
interior is flat out awesome! Nothing rattles or moves when the case is
loaded with one cue or three. It's not loose in anyway, and it's not
tighter than a gnats ass when fully loaded either and there is plenty
of room in-between the cues. There's a very nice "snug" fit when you
insert a cue. <br>
<br>
All in all I have nothing negative to say about
this case. It exceeds my expectations in every way possible. I couldn't
see myself ever going back to an It's George case as a daily carrier so
I sold my 3x6 here last night. <br>
<br>
This case gets a 5 star rating from me.<br>
If your considering one of these and are skeptical find somebody that
has one and check it out!<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------>
<br>
I find it&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">the</span>
best buy in its price category, in fact, I'm not sure I'll ever spend
less on a cue case again (after using an original "J.EF Q Case" from
Jay Flowers - made by Nora Van Horn, of course - for many years, still
in good condition, by the way, I started buying cheap ones and replace
them once they start falling apart).<br>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">GTF
Cases... a review - 12-28-2007, 02:08 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Well
well well, what do I have here....</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">A
brandy new GTF case for review....</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Let
me start off by saying, anyone who knows RSB knows that John Barton
and I have had our differences. So by no means am I schilling for his
case design. In fact I probably hoped I could find a lot wrong so I
could tell him he can't even copy worth damn.. but that is not the
case, no pun intended.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have a smooth leather 1 x 2 GTF case. So let me begin my review...</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Presentation
is very nice.. the bag it came in is very nice. A product tag, a key
ring with key and swatch of leather. I have to say, this part is
really well done. Grade A</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Latch:
Now everyone knows any latch John picks out is suspect. But this is a
nice brushed brass tone latch that does the job. The latch also has
definition, little extra accent on the ends. The key works, one
revolution clockwise to lock, counter to unlock. So far so good after
12 times. The latch on mine is attached via screws so if I needed to
I could remove the latch with minimal effort. I could say that they
should be riveted. But lets face reality, on all these style of cases
you can pry the latch off with no problem. Grade: A, if it starts
failing D.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Leatherwork:
The seam is very good, the ends are very good. In fact the ends are
finished nicer than the Kelli I have and the Fellini. I will use it
and see how it all stays together, but right now its very, very
clean. Grade A</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Tube
work: Cap: It looks like its a three piece cap. The extruded tube,
and a top insert, and a cap. The cap is probably molded and has a rim
that allows it to sit flush in the top of the tube. *guessing*This is
probably a better design than a glued in cap. Plus I would think it
would double as the bottom assembly. Case is longer than my Fellini.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Liner:
The plush fabric is better than the thinner fabric. BUT I think its
too tight. I know JB likes to turn his cases over and not have his
cue hit the floor. However, I store my cues in these tube cases the
following way: Shafts, tip up, butt screw down. Why? Less chalk in
the tubes. It's a squeeze getting my cue in and I don't know if
anything bad is happening while I do this. The butt swells the end of
the case and the top needed to be finagled on. I will say I believe
an older cue with a big butt is not going to fit into this case.
Grade: B</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">What
I would change. Move away from the Fellini style label. Stamp the
ends, bottom of the case, get rid of the white label, the Fellini tag
is iconic.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Overall
this case is a low A - strong B.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
in all, the case seems to do what it is supposed to. I will use it
for a few weeks then update my report. I cannot fathom any issues
with such a simplistic case design. I look forward to seeing the 2 x
4 at some point.</font></p>

Replica 1X2 - 12-15-2009, 03:11 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
is my review of the GTF replica series 1x2 in rust lizard print.
Contact Tony (Benfica) for a great selection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">1st
Thank you John Barton for building and designing this line!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">2nd
Those that already own one already know all of this.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Now
on to the case. The first thing I noticed is how well the leather is
fitted to the case. Being a "Replica" series it was one of
the 1st things I looked at. The finishing on the end caps of the case
is true perfection. The second thing I noticed about the case was
balance and texture. This case just feels good in your hand. I bought
a lizard print case and the texture that is embossed into the leather
itself is nice and deep. That along with the thickness grade of
leather used gives a very strong impression that this case is armored
well for my cue. Then you notice the length of the case and lid space
and realize this case will take any size joint protector on almost
any length cue. A true collector's case. Upon removing the lid I was
also so very impressed at how the material wrapped tube suctioned and
worked better than the old style It's George cases. So what do I find
inside but more fit and finish that is top notch. The material used
is so soft yet strong. You find this desire to just keep popping the
lid off this case because it feels that nice. So I slide my cue into
the caseummm yeah, and I thought at first oh no it won't fit! Well I
kept going and it hit bottom nice and snug and though this must be
the "Lovable Hug" I heard about. Next went in the shafts to
the same nice snug fit. Kinda like tucking your kids in at night.
Except the cues come first right? Just kidding. So there it was all
snuggled in new GTF protection and then I slid the lid on. WOW! I
said to myself. I own and collect It's George cases and swore they
could never be improved upon. Well like my wife says "I was
wrong again". In fact I can not think or find one thing about
the case that I would change. Try it for yourself and see. As for
buying a new case of this traditional design I can not see buying any
other brand. My only request to John and GTF is I really need a 3x6
So this case is easy to sum up if you are giving GTF a thought. This
is a nice case $195 to $300+. Ultimate protection for your cue

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
received my first ''Kopy Kat Case'' today,,,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It
features all of the wonderful traits of the ''GTF'' replica at a
fraction of the price,,!!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
one I purchased is a gorgeous grey, it includes a lush, brown
protective cover that easily and snugly close with a quality draw
string...</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
seam on the case is flawless and is far superior to the many seams
that I seen on ''Fellini's''..</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
top lid features an insert with the ''Kopy Kat Case'' logo, I'm told
that down the road, cue makers can have their name and logo adorned
in the insert as well,,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case boasts the ''loveable hug'' that is consistent with all ''GTF''
cases,,as well as the ''GTF'' tag inside the case,,,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
lid closes with a very cool ''Whoosh'' sound as the vacume is sealed
to protect the cue,,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case looks like leather, feels like leather and has that ''new car
smell like leather'' but alas, it made from a very high quality
Vinyl,,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Overall,
a wonderful value in a stunning cue case !!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">As
far as that case goes it is by far the nicest case that I have ever
owned. I really loved it. It was a GTF 2x4. The simple design and top
notch execution was awesome. It was a shame that I fell on some hard
times and had to sell it. Damn schooling for the wife. LOL.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
will say also that Mr. Barton was very easy to deal with and the
shipping time from China was incredible. He even let me ship the item
that I traded to him to his father in law here in the states so I
didnt have to pay for the shipping to China. I think that JB is the
way to go if you want a super nice case that is still affordable and
great customer service.</font></p>

1x2 case!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">i
got mine in leather with ostrich texture so i can't review this case
for the leather. What i can say is that this is the best PROTECTIVE
case you can buy for a 1x2. Period.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It's
solid and extremely well built with nice detailed finishing. The
interior is the highlight of the case, it hugs the cue and really
protects them. Everytime i remove the cap of the tube i hear a "pop"
sound as the fitting is so good there's a vacuum effect. This is
value for money, you get the best protection from case maker John
Barton and you get a nice case that looks like a Fellini! Can't
complain!!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana"> </font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Ron
makes a top shelf case with outside latchless top that snaps on and
locks into place. Probably has a better(larger) selection of outside
materials available to customize what you want.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
am impressed with the inside works of the GTF. The material used is
very soft and will not scratch or mark your gems. Also with the top
removed(just a tight friction fit) on the GTF you can turn the case
upside down and the butt or the shafts will not fall out. If you
shake it they will but not by just turning it over. They are somehow
"foam" fitted like a glove to your cue and hang on to them.
The thing I didn't like about the GTF was the seam work on the case
itself.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
I remember correctly they were both priced pretty close to the same
but really can't remember that either since it's been so long that I
got them both.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
I had to get another I would go with the Thomas just because you
can't beat working with Ron. He does get a little back logged at
times as he stays very busy and works at his own pace.</font></p>

Flowers Tribute Cases a review from a Confessed Cue Case Junkie -
12-25-2008, 08:53 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
was the runner up in John Barton?s Contest to give away a Jay Flower
Tribute Case, I won a 1 x 2 Jay Flower Tribute Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
asked John if he would consider allowing me to upgrade the Case to a
2 x 4. John was kind enough to allowing me to upgrade the Case to a 2
x 4, and pay a price difference for the upgrade.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
Case is pictured here, and was shipped out of Xiamen China on
12/18/2008 (Last Thursday) it was in my hands 12/22/2008 (this Past
Monday) delivered by United Parcel Service, after UPS became the
delivery company for TNT, John?s Shipper in China.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">After
finding out I was a Winner, finalizing my order, my order was placed
November 5, 2008. Delivery took just over 6 weeks to get my Case in
The Sonora Desert. I understand John, and Staff are now delivering
Jay Flowers Tribute Cases in about 30 days from order.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John?s
Staff Packed the Case well for shipment overseas to protect it from
all shipping hazards these days, the box arrived in perfect condition
plastered with more shipping labels than I had ever seen covering a
single box, and the Case came with a VERY NICE Cloth Draw String
Protective Bag no one else has mentioned who has received a Jay
Flowers Tribute Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">One
of my most important requirement for the Case was it be able to
accommodate Cue Butts &amp; Shafts Sections UP to 31-3/4 INCHES in
Length with Joint Protectors. John accomplish this, as I have a Cue
with RADIAL PIN, and JP that NEED that EXTRA LENGTH many Case do not
offer!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
Case was originally to be a Dark Dark Brown with Tan Tooling, and
Letters, but John and I made a CHANGE that apparently did not make it
to his workers, and I got an e-mail from John, with pictures titled
"See if this works".</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">After
looking at the pictures of the Case John e-mailed me, posted by link
above, I said it will work, ship it, but believe if it had not
worked, I truely believe John would have done the Case over to make
it right. In the end John's Staff pulled off some great color
matching.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Honestly
when I got the Case in my hands the CONTRAST between the Case Body
Color, and Tooling/Letters Color was what I had envisioned. Can you
say a DREAM CAME TRUE. I did not want an extreme amount of contrast,
more of a subdued effect. The Case's Body Color is Dark Dark Brown,
and the Tooling, and Letters Color are almost Gold-ish Dark Tan.
Honestly it looks just great, and the people who have seen it in
person make compliment on John's work.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Oh
yes my Case is a 2 x 4, has the Black Plush Interior and Weights in
DRY/Empty Weight of 5# 15.40 OZ. According to the Scale at the Post
Office.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would describe the hardware high quality, the color as like an
Antique Brass Color, and compliments well with the Gold-ish Dark Tan
Color of the Tooling, and Letters on my Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say the fit and finish of my Case is right up there with the
other Best Case Makers out there, and everything lines up perfectly
like the Stitching, Tooling Patterns, Rivet Placement, Zipper
Placement, etc., and I would only guess John?s, and his Staff puts a
great deal of effort into trying their hardest to turn out as perfect
a Case as they can each time they build a Jay Flowers Tribute Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Lets
talk about the Pockets, the Small One measures approx. 8.0 Inches
long, x 3.5 Inches Wide, and about 1.25 Inches Deep. The Large Pocket
is 15.25 Inches long, x 3.5 Inches Wide, about 1.25 Inches Deep, and
has a SEPARATE Zipper to access a Cloth Lined Compartment for a Jump
Butt. The pockets are EASY to get all that stuff I carry in and out
of, so I would say the Pockets are very user friendly.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Shoulder Carry Strap, and Pad easily deploy, and retracts for easy
use, and storage. There is a ROUGH Leather Back on the Shoulder Pad
so it does not slip off your shoulder. Yes I tested this on walk over
to play pool.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">IF
I was going to order another one of these Cases, I would add some
Tooling Pattern, or Initials to the Shoulder Pad, and maybe ask that
the Carry Handle, and Top Handle be Tooled to Match the Cases Body
Tooling Pattern. Just an idea to others considering a Jay Flowers
Tribute Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Note
as I said above I chose the Black Plush Interior, and I put Cue Butts
and Shafts into the Case, and they fit snug but are easily taken in
and out. I would bet if I held the Case Upside Down they would not
come falling out. As Cue Butts and Shafts fit as said SNUG. There
also seem to be a Pop Up System Installed at the cases bottom, to
make removal of Shafts, and or Butts sections smooth as a breeze.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have linked John?s Order information, for the Jay Flowers Tribute
Cases, that should answer most questions about the Jay Flowers
Tribute Cases, Their Pricing, and Color Options for the Jay Flowers
Tribute Cases. I will add I feel John?s Prices are very fair for a
Leather Semi Custom Pool Cue Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Thank
you John Barton, and Staff for a job well done. You, and your staff
sent me a great Jay Flowers Tribute Case,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
I think Jay Flowers would be proud of your work also.</font></p>

Flowers case review - 10-29-2008, 07:58 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would like to start off saying that I am proud to have the first of
these cases.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case is built to withstand. The case construction is rigid. The tubes
firmly hold the cue and shafts in place. The lining is soft and very
smooth.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
leather is very solid in every area. The case comes with a padded
shoulder strap. Above I listed alot of positives. The most of all to
be mentioned should be the value. The price of these is beyond
reasonable.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">With
every fair review there must be negatives and I will give them here.
With the safety and construction of this case comes weight. There is
an optional lighter interior, but I am commenting on my case. It is
heavy.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
design of the shoulder strap pad is such that I believe the padding
may wear excessively overtime. The pad feels almost like gel-padding
which has never proven to me to be suitable over long periods. The
strap itself released fairly easily when I first got it. I did have a
towel ring which likely caused it since after moving the ring I have
had no issue.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
think the cases are great and cannot be rivaled at the price John has
them for sale. Good luck</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Sincerly,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Proud

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
just had to get a review out there for the Flowers Tribute cases
being offered by/through John Barton, aka JB Cases. I received mine
today, and am totally thrilled. The colors and tooling came out
beautifully, and I could not be happier. I highly recommend this to
anybody out there. You won't be disappointed. Thanks John, Matt.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I've
have 2, 1 I ordered for my brother for christmas, can't wait to give
it to him, it's #31, mine is #12.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">You
can not find a case this well made, with custom features at this
price. They are beautiful, sturdy/solid, people notice my case right
away.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have 2 Justis cases, had 4 Whittens, it's georges, instrokes. And for
me, John Bartons cases are right up there with my Justis's, yes, Jack
is a legend and those cases speak for them selves (not getting rid of
mine any time soon) but for those who don't have $600+ to order a new
one, and have it customized there is no better case than these.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
personaly never liked instrokes clasps,knobs, whatever you call them,
too many people coming up to me at tournaments asking if I had
replacements, or could fix them. And I love the J flowers/Justis
style cases.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
I had to give 1 draw back, and I wouldn't want it changed, is the
pocket depth, the zippers and my hands don't always get along. Other
than this, they are pieces of affordable, functional art.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
love my brother, but if it weren't for the affordability of these
cases, he'd be getting a gift certificate to the MEAT LOCKER.</font></p>

Tribute Case Review - 07-02-2009, 02:06 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">"I
just got my Barton/Flowers case last week.
http://www.jbcases.com/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=5173</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It
is beautiful. Truly beautiful. I should post pics but I can't at
work, so that was just the ordering link.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Now,
if I wanted to make it drop- dead perfect, I would have pockets like
on some of his other cases- where they're lined with soft linen and
have wrap- around zippers so you can open them wide like a display
case (great for signed dollars!). These pockest are stiff and
unlined, but I expect they'll soften soon enough.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">As
it is, it was an incredible deal (even if he had charged $100 more
it'd be a deal), looks awesome, smells like a new Coach purse, and
has my name right on the shoulderpad in case someone asks me and I
totally blank and can't remember.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Not
only did it arrive earlier than expected but the attn to detail was
amazing: every flower is lined up perfectly with the lines of the
case and with the crescents in the patterns. Anything a little "off"
would have bothered me- I'm that picky.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Actually...
it's way better than a new Coach purse. "</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">You
truly have a lovely case- congratulations on a good purchase. I think
going for the plain, simple lines the way that you did really brings
out the smooth beauty of the case. It's pretty enough on its own to
not be "plain" at all. And you know that your cues will be
well- protected.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">For
my own part, I had a very very small issue with my case that I
mentioned to John about two weeks after receipt. He seems to know
everyone- he immediately contacted a casemaker in my area who then
contacted me, met with me, did the necessary small fixes beautifully,
and then returned the case to me. At no charge or hassle at all.
There were no accusations, arguments, difficulties, shipping costs-
nothing.</font></p>

not only do you have a beautiful case, I am confident that you also

had picked one of these up about a month or so ago.I can say that I
am very pleased with my purchase.It has become my everyday case.It's
a 2x4.Everything fits nice and tight.I even can flip it up-side down
with the lid open and nothing falls out.I feel very safe with my cues
in it.For the money as far as protecting my cues I'm finding it hard
to believe there's anything better on the market today.I'd just like
to say TAP...TAP...JB!!Great work on a great product!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">After
being a long time It's George fan I decided that JB's Ultra Pad
interior was just calling my name for me to test out. I now own a 3x6
Flowers tribute case and I can't say enough about how happy I am with
it. The exterior of this case is very easy on the eyes. It looks very
well built with quality hardware and it seems "Heavy Duty"
but is surprisingly light in weight. Both pockets large and small
have the "L" zipper configuration and makes accessing these
areas very easy. The large pocket also has a 3rd zipper with a very
nice sewn in Pocket to hold a jump cue handle.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Now
the good part......This Ultra Pad interior is flat out awesome!
Nothing rattles or moves when the case is loaded with one cue or
three. It's not loose in anyway, and it's not tighter than a gnats
ass when fully loaded either and there is plenty of room in-between
the cues. There's a very nice "snug" fit when you insert a
cue.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
in all I have nothing negative to say about this case. It exceeds my
expectations in every way possible. I couldn't see myself ever going
back to an It's George case as a daily carrier so I sold my 3x6 here
last night.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case gets a 5 star rating from me</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
your considering one of these and are skeptical find somebody that
has one and check it out!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case came out fantastic!! John is a fantastic guy to work with. Was
quoted completion mid to end October but just received an email it
was shipped out this morning!! By the way check out the bottom of the
case. A red piece of leather was added with the "made for"
info instead of just stamping the black case leather....looks very
classy.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">As
for my case... i took it to my first tournement yesterday, the
tournement was played in a downtown area with about 8 bars in a 2
block radius. players walked from bar to bar to play there next
match, and i must say that the flowers tribute 3x6 isnt light. (i was
carying 2 butts and 5 shafts) i wouldnt campare it to the ruck sak i
luged around in the military but if i wern't a young buck i might be
irritated by its weight. The sholder strap pad provides just enough
padding to make it comfortable to carry.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Love
the ultrapad interior and the protection the entire case provides.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Love
the finish and the look.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Love
the storage space, i can carry all my tools and my 2 playing cues and
still have space for an opportune buy if needed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">L
shaped zippers are not the smoothist but may free up over time as the

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I've
used Whitten cases for the past 10 years or so...they are of the
highest quality. With that said...for the past couple months I've
been using one of John Barton's JB cases with the rebound interior.
John built the case exactly to my specs with the features I wanted. I
couldn't be more pleased with the case &amp; quality....and I can say
without doubt that it indeed offers the finest protection available.
Mine is a 4x8 thats smaller than most other cases that hold fewer
cues. I'll be using JB cases from now on. John Barton will go out of
his way to help you get exactly the case you want. I could not be
happier with my new JB case.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">mdavis228/Chris
Davis</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
was a case that sprang to mind after seeing John post a case he
called "Chocolate Love" some time back. I contacted him
with my ideas &amp; he returned my call promptly (allow for him being
on the other side of the world). He was real easy to work with &amp;
accomodating in helping bring my wishes to reality.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case is a serious piece of leather equipment. Just looking at it
brings the term high quality to mind, and when you feel it you know
you were right. The leather is very thick &amp; strong, but still
feels pliant. The fit and connectivity is tight &amp; secure. The
hardware is top knotch in quality &amp; aesthetics - in this case a
black chromed finish, very nice. The stitching on this one is black
against the brown tones. The leather color is tone on tone in
luxurious browns. I asked for the bulk of the case - including all of
the "handled" areas - to be rich oil tanned leather. The
front &amp; back center panels, the lid, and the id patches are done
in a vegetable tanned leather that is just a shade lighter in color
with an antiqued finish. John pulled the coloration off spot on to
what I wanted. All of the snaps are very solid &amp; utile, and the
zippers work efficiently &amp; with ease. You don't have to force or
fight them, just give a gentle steady pull &amp; they move smoothly.
As you can see, I was interested in providing for a wealth of
accessible, available, useful storage, and again, all is well. The
pockets are well made, well sewn, plenty large, and you can get to
&amp;
use all the space provided. Love the jp pocket w/ magnetic closure.
The shoulder strap stows nicely with the provided snapping leather
rings, and the towel ring placement provides excellent symmetry for
threading the towel thru the carrying handle and/or shoulder strap
when carrying.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">As
for cue protection, there is none better. This case has the natural
rebound interior which provides great padding &amp; the benefit that
the pieces tend to "pop gently up" as you unstow them. Each
butt &amp; shaft (and this case is set up to facillitate 3 butts/4
shafts or 2 butts/5 shafts) stays separated from one another even
above the sleeves - nothing touches. The parts go in easily, but
snuggly, and there is no reason to concern yourself with any of the
silly abrasion concerns that have been spouted. No problem. One of my
cues is a jet black Gaboon Ebony butt sleeve. I'd notice if it was
being scratched. There is definitely no concern for the safety of
your equipment when it is in this case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It's
not a light case, but I didn't place any value on that for my
purposes.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
I would have done anything differently, I may have had the zipper on
the center pocket extend to the bottom on the "handle side"
for access clear to the bottom - straight in, but I've not felt at
any loss for it. I have LOTS of storage room - and I took stock of
what I wanted from many years of case use.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
I have one suggestion for John in improving the interior it would be
this...</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Once
in a while, the top of a sleeve will "lay over" when you
are putting a component in, causing you to have to "work it in"
a little. Nothing major at all. If the interior sleeves were taller,
allowing an average person's finger to reach it easily, the material
could be pushed back &amp; ease installing the butt or shaft at those
infrequent times. It's been mostly the butts that I've experinced
this with - and only sporadically.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
provided an innovative "plug" for one compartment that
holds my 2 piece Lomax jump cue butt up with the rest. It has a long
flap that extends approx 6 inches above the sleeves, so you can push
the flap down into an adjacent sleeve. This gets it out of the way -
almost invisible - but would be easy to remove if you wanted to do
so. Nice idea! And it does stay put.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Lastly...
I wanted to personalize the case subtly with just my 1st name,
"Chris". John had me hand write my name on a piece of
computer paper &amp; fax it to him. Then they laser engraved/tooled
my hand sig into a circular, inset, patch centered on the middle
pocket. They dyed the patch like the antiqued case panels so that it
is very subtle.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I'm
very happy with the whole process of designing this case &amp;
interacting with John to get it moving forward, and the case that I
received as a result - and rec'd ON TIME as advertised - is
everything I hoped for &amp; then some. It is a very, very fine piece
of work.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">New
JB Custom Case - 08-31-2010, 07:22 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Well
the wait is over, I have received my JB Cases-Custom Case, and it is
now time to share the story. First I wish to thank John Barton and
his team, including the talented Zhen Hai his Master Leather Worker (
pronounced GEN-HI) who was responsible for part of the tooling
design, and all of the leather tooling. Think Zhen Hai ‘s Leather
Works ROCKS! He is IMHO right there on the top of the pile with the
best leather workers in the world.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
idea for this Cue Case came about because I was seeking what I would
like to call the “Perfect Pool Cue Case”, for me to carry what I
use. I started calling the project, the “Element’s
Case”,(&lt;&lt;&lt;---PHOTOS LINKED AT LEFT) when I realized I was
putting elements of what I liked in other Pool Cue Cases that I own,
or have previously owned, or had the opportunity to look at, and
examine real close!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
decided I wanted a Cue Case built to hold, 3 Cue Butt Sections, &amp;
4 Cue Shafts, so I could carry the following with ease. Playing Cue
with Two Shafts, a Break Cue with a Single Shaft, a Jump Handle with
a Single Jump Shaft, and in last a Butt Section Slot, was the place
for carrying my John Hager Extension. Think the Brown Colored Ultra
Pad Interior works well with the over all, color, and design of the
case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Plus
I again choose to have John’s Ultra Pad Interior Liner, for MAXIMUM
CUE PROTECTION! Like John offers in his line of Jay Flowers Tribute
Pool Cue Cases, that I personally consider, a “best buy” in a
leather pool cue case, because of all the options offered at little
or no cost. Lots of bang for the buck in those Jay Flowers Tribute
Pool Cue Cases</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
also request deeper than NORMAL Pockets, (Approx. 2” Deep) as I
have this Pro-Just-A-Bridge I love to use, but because of the
Pro-Just-A-Bridge's bulk, it often get left at home as it didn’t
fit into my other Pool Cue Cases. Plus the Pool Cue Case has room for
cell phone, reading glasses, pool rule book, accessories up the
wazoo, change of clothing, including extra pair of cowboy boots, LOL,
etc. Yes I carry too much junk.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Also
as I am a South Pawed I asked John to set up the Case to be carried
in my Left Hand with Pockets away from the body, Top/Lid Forward, the
way another Cue Casemaker sets up his cases. The other reason I asked
for Left Hand Carry is a problem with my Right Shoulder, that I just
can not too carry much weigh in my Right Arm because of the problem
creates pain.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Also
the Jump Butt Compartment &amp; Zipper is on the Side where my Side
Carry Handle is for ease of getting at the J/B Handle. Plus I can see
if I left the compartment open before walking too far.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case has the similar profile of a Pool Cue Case John did previously,
it was called , “The Palace Garden”, but I wanted more bare
leather showing, I think the tooling that was done on my case flowed
together well. The Pool Cue Case John did called, The Ranchero Case
was the inspiration for less tooling, and more leather showing.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have had the opportunity to look over the Element’s Pool Cue Case
real well in good light last evening, I know I have a critical eye
for detail, and I would rate the workmanship a 10 ++ out of a
possible 10. Honestly everything lines up perfectly, and it all works
like the Marine Corps Precision Drill Team in Washington, D.C. The
Zipper Placement, Stitching , Fit &amp; Finish, etc., is all just way
beyond great construction. Lets say John, and his teams attention to
detail is like striving for perfection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
really like the Puzzle Latch, John Barton created, and is now
incorporating in many cases, as it was designed to replace trouble
some Turn Locks, Purse Type Twist Locks, and Snaps that can with time
developed problems. The Earth Magnets John uses in the Puzzle Latch
are said to loose 1% of their power every ten years, so the Magnets I
am sure will be working flawless when I am long gone.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
also incorporated a Chalk &amp; Joint Protector holder in the Top
Pocket. The Case has John’s newly designed Rubber Foot, to keep the
Cue Case from slipping on a slippery floor when leaned against
something. Dry or Empty Weight of this 3 Butts, 4 Shaft Pool Cue Case
is 6 # 1.6 OZ.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
took the Pool Cue Case over to our Community Leather Club where I
live yesterday afternoon before dinner, I asked a few of the members
how they would rate the workmanship. Got lost of ooze, aaaazzzz, and
nothing but compliments. One guy asked about the Chinese letters on
the bottom, and I said it was the mans name who did the tooling work,
and he is in what I call the "Old Red China", were the Pool
Cue Case was built. This Leather Club Member who did the most
talking, said he did not realize the Chinese were capable of such a
work, was totally impressed with the quality of work, and all the
attention to small details, that he made a point to point out to me.
Like all the Tiny Swivel Knife Cuts in the Side of the Case, Carry
Strap, Top Handle, Side Handle, Under the the Top Positions of the
Body of the Case that he said was the mark of a very skilled
craftsmen who took his craft seriously.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
was the same kind feedback I got on my Jay Flowers Tribute Pool Cue
Case, that I took it over to the Community Leather Club, a year ago
for critique, and comments.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
honestly think John, and his Team have hit a Home Run with the
Element’s Case, I am one happy camper. What I received, it is
beyond my wildest expectations. I will honestly say if you have a
idea for a Custom Pool Case with Logo, Artwork, Special Configured,
etc., you would like to see come to see come life. I would highly
recommend John, and his Team for your project, as they are more than
capable of turning a simple ideas into Magic. Making suggestions on
what functions', what don’t function. What works, what don’t work
in Pool Cue Case design, and turning your ideas into great Pool Cue
Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
will take the liberty of giving John Barton, a new AKA. That being
King of the Pool Cue Casemakers, as John is been at this Pool Cue
Case Build thing over two decades, he is constantly reinventing Pool
Cue Case Design, he can build about any style of Pool Cue Case, or
any configuration of Pool Cue Case, and is constantly looking to do
Pool Cue Cases that not only look great, but offer the best
protection for Pool Cues.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
happen to be the lucky winner of the first JB Custom case designed by
me and John Barton. This case is a 3 x 6 with the same inside
configuration. I have had this case since May 2008 and have had
expensive cues in ths case constantly. I even have a jump cue butt in
one of the SHAFT sleeves that stays in place and doesn't fall to the
bottom of the case (they stretch) with no damage to any other shaft
or butt.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have had no problems with any of my cues being in this case NONE.
They actually protect the butts/shafts better since they don't move
around (as tube cases do). They also don't accidently fall out. Best
design in a case IMO.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
went with a Barton case. I looked at all the case makers...I liked
what John did the best.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
had zero problems working with him. He was super helpful, and even
took the time to talk with me on the phone for about an hour going
over the details of the custom case I wanted.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I

Barton Cases - 02-17-2010, 02:55 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
new John Barton cue case finally arrived! I'm very impressed with the
level of protection my cues' getting from my GTF case, and expected
nothing less from the JB case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Things
I like about the case:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
The case came with a cloth bag. Nice touch.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
There were little "gifts" like extra rivets, a leather
pouch with JB Cases name cards, and a burnisher. 2 thumbs up!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
Nice looking zippers which were quite easy to pull.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
Sturdy and solid cap.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
The interior is what I like most. Butts and shafts are held down so
securely by the soft interior that they wouldn't fall out even if I
turned the case upside down.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
Overall, the case was built very well, no visible flaws. It felt very
sturdy and hardy, and yet not heavy.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Things
I didn't quite like:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
I had specifically asked for the jump cue compartment to be able to
fit a jump cue butt measuring 14.5 inches. I measured the jump cue
compartment and the zipper measured exactly 14.5 inches. It was a
very tight fit and extremely difficult to get the cue in with or
without joint protector. Eventually I decided to do without the joint
protector because I didn't want bloodied fingers from the struggles
with the zippers. Even without joint protector, it was still very
difficult to get the jump cue butt in. Every time I squeeze it in,
the zippers would scratch my cue. It's a 250 dollar Josey jump cue,
and I'm not sure if I should continue placing it in the jump
compartment.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
Communication via email with JB Cases wasn't exactly prompt in the
initial stage. Even after I've paid in full for the case, I waited
one month for their reply. I can understand if they are too busy to
start working on my case, I don't mind queuing, but it's just
impolite to ignore my emails for a month. Although I must say that
they were super fast in building the case, it took less than a month
from the final confirmation to the case reaching me! So that kinda
made me felt better about being ignored.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">-
Their customer service also lacked a personal touch. I was only told
that my case was on the way to me after they've shipped it out. I had
wanted it to be shipped to another address, but they took their own
initiative to ship it to my paypal address. It would have been much
better if they had told me that it's done and confirmed my shipping
details before sending it out.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Would
I buy from JB Cases again? DEFINITELY YES! The freedom to fully
customize my case and the superior interior are more than enough
reasons for me to buy again.</font></p>

chas cases - 09-09-2011, 08:16 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
recently ordered a fancy cowboy tooled case from John Barton</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">because
of my vague instructions and request we never got it fished</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">we
probably will before long ,but John felt bad so he sent me 2 Chas
cases</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">2x4
handle only for the same price as the one i paid for.He even offered
to tool them at no cost to me</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
felt like it was way too much for him to offer,so I requested two
with no strap,pouches or tooling</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">AND</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
got what I consider to be the perfect pool cue case for me.The size
is compact ,handy,manageable,the style is rustic western chic,less is
more,kinda what you would expect for a Texas cowboy</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">In
conclusion,John Barton is a very honorable person to do business
with.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">His
cases are as good as you could possibly want.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
recieve my JB Case a little over a week ago.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It's
just a sweet plain jane no tooling case. I'm not into fancy.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
first thing I have to say is thank you John &amp; Karen for putting
up with me.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">And
second this case is built like a brick shit house.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Every
thing is built so tight. Especially the 3x4 ultra pad interior. At
first I didn't think I could get 3 butts &amp; 4 shafts in it. But I
did,very secure!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have to say I was a little skeptic about John's magnetic latch on my
3rd pocket but let me tell you that I'm a believer now.(very strong
pull)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Also
the puzzle latch on the top lid is probably tighter &amp; more
durable then if it was made out of brass.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Even
the zippers are tight. (Thinking about putting a couple drops of
silicone on them)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
handles are stiff &amp; sturdy. The leather John used is good quality
&amp; thick. It might even be bullet proof.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
only disappointment was that the little leather pouch John sent me
was brown &amp; not black. One thing John should have learned about
me is I like black leather.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">And
also I didn't get a JB cloth burnisher.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
in all I want to thank John &amp; Karen again.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">One
more thing, I don't know about anyone else but it's hard for me to
spend $$$ on a product that I can't hold in my hands before I buy it.
Especially ordering it from China. And that's what I went through
decideing about buying a JB case. But I'm gonna tell you JB cases is
very professional &amp; reliable &amp; would buy from them again.</font></p>

cowboy leather plain jane chocolate brown 3 butts 4 shafts or 2 butts
5 shafts - 10-15-2011, 05:16 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Got
this case about 3 years ago, I still get compliments and I am not
easy on my cases, looks great even with the scuffs(next one will be
saddle leather--I love how it looks ruffed up after a while)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Its
a 2 butt 5 shaft or 3 butt 4 shaft soft interior dividers....now the
fit is so nice and snug without being to snug as to use extra force
to remove or put in that the cues dont move----I also have the top
handle(a must), a side handle(another must), and a shoulder strap
that is removeable with snaps, there is no velcroe(thank god), all
straps and handles are stiched or tooled or they use the snaps.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have had many who have asked if the case was for sale but its not at
the moment......paid $475 shipped, waited couple months or so, there
was no comunication issues if you have the patience to wait a few
days for replies(guys got other things to do, like build cases)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">also
has a jump handle pocket</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">(I
wish someone could figure out how to move that pocket away from your
tip tools pocket and extra gear pocket so if you own a custom or
matching jump cue it wont get bumped around by your extra goodies you
never know when you will need.)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
the main bottom pocket which fits most normal pool items. I have a
jump/break cue(The stinger-breaks good, but Jumps the best of all
J/B's, my opinion.) So I can fit a few extras because theres no jump
cue handle.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Also
has a top pocket. Normal to a little bit bigger than average.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Best
part about the pockets are they are zippered...no more broken twisty
release tabs that break after not to long(or, from shipping-brand
new, broke and I never used it, its a 2x4 mcdermott collectors
addition with the self standing legs....the top latch to hold the
cues in broke in shipping.)</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">JB
cases work great, a little heavy but thats what you want to protect
your cues.....the snaps on the shoulder strap and the top handle
sometimes come unsnapped is about the only complaints if I think
hard, and thoughs may be partially my fault or the company who makes
the snaps.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Anyways,
dont even think twice if you can afford this type of case and want
one that will last for as long as you play pool then</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">get
a JB Case</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Thats

“rugged” case (= prototype?) - 10-15-2011, 01:56 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
is the most useful everyday case I’ve ever owned. Period. Weighs
roughly 60 ounces empty and looks elegant, almost slim given all that
(even a little more, if needed!) fits in! (Those self-made textile
wrappers are for the playing cue extension and the jump cue butt –
the large pocket has one side compartment for a jump cue handle, not
long enough for both parts.) Stable, most versatile and space-saving
2x5 (2 butts, 5 shafts) = 3x4 (3 butts, 4 shafts) UltraPad interior
that ensures everything is well-protected and nothing accidentally
slips out of the case. Wish the interior weren’t black (e.g. red or
blue would be preferred), as I seem to be getting night-blind enough
to where, in a darkly-lit pool hall, I’m unable to see the
compartments. The L-shaped zippered pockets are a definite
improvement over those on e.g. my Flowers Tribute 2x4, virtually
impossible to get in/remove e.g. a ProJusta bridge head there, let
alone tuck it under or over a rubber Q Claw cue holder. Pockets are
not higher, but the softness and flexibility of the canvas is making
things easier also (even so, an eighth or quarter of an inch higher
pockets wouldn’t hurt). The rubber bottom may not look like much
but makes great sense – as slip-resistant as any. The case is light
and very comfortable to wear over one shoulder (mine came with
shoulder pad otherwise same as on the pictures on John Barton’s web
site) or – my preferred way – diagonally across one’s back. The
strap can easily be taken off, if one prefers. Would love to have a
fancy tooled leather 2x5/3x4 JB case, but for the time being, this
will do nicely!</font></p>

Case after a few weeks or so. . . - 12-02-2010, 06:52 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">1.
How well does it protect?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It
protects great. What can I say, it is a JB Ultrapad interior. It
lives up to that name and more. It has nice thick padding which keeps
a gap between each piece. What is funny, is it does this all in a
smaller case. This case is a 3 x 6, but from the outside I would
swear it is a 2 x 4. Everything on this case is about protection. If
I knock it over at the pool hall, the pieces are held down in the
case, even when it falls over. With the zipper closed, it is as
secure as is possible in a case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say A++ for protection, but. . .of course, it's a JB.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">2.
How strong are the handles, straps and latches?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Everything
is JB's best quality hardware, so no worries there. The handles are
sewn directly to the case which makes them feel very secure. Thee
back pack straps and pads seem to be a new method for John, but they
pull the straps in tight and allow them to float loose. They are a
similar shape and design to a real back pack strap. Good work on the
pads and straps John! I have to add an extra attaboy in here because
I was especially picky about this point since I walk to the pool
hall.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Definitely,
A grade stuff here.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">3.
How comfortable is the case to use?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say very good. Everything goes in easy and works as expected.
The extra pockets are super. If you get a case from John, get the FR
surface pockets! The only negatives are the backpack straps don't
slide in and out as easily as a real backpack, but the are leather
too, which might be more sticky. Also, the Ultrapad is so firm, I
have to pull cues out by the JP's. This is the way I wanted it
though. There is another interior which is a bit looser. Nice big
zippers with pulls!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say A for ease of use. It is basically all A+, except for the
sliding of the backpack straps which I think will improve with break
in.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">4.
How well done is the fit and finish?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
outside is tight to the tube. The inside is well shaped. The pockets
were well designed and constructed. I did special request they be
extra tall pockets which makes them easily squished. Still, I need
the height. All the details are right. The sewing, tabs, zipper
pulls, zipper on the side, rubber foot .. . everything was well
executed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say A.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">5.
How well done is the decoration?</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Most
cases have tooling, or decoration. This is a daily use case. It's
decoration is in the textured leathers and color patterns. Everything
turned out well. Pretty good color balance. The next one will be made
from the $30,000 croc hide!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would say B, but this is a utility case. It does what it is supposed
to well. I wanted this to be a C or D level as far as decorative
quality goes. Besides I can't give all A's!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">6.
Intangibles</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
is where JB wins you over. He was always easily accessible on Skype.
He was good about emails. He understood what I was asking for. He was
very reasonable when changes were made to things he had worked on. He
did everything in his power to build my perfect case. He built this
one my way and can build yours as you wish!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">A++
here.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case does more than any other case on the market IMO, and JB Case was
the right kind of company to build it. I needed someone who would't
be stuck on their previous designs and patterns.</font></p>

Scotland case, I call it the Heritage - 11-07-2011, 12:53 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Hi
this is just a short review of what I call the Heritage case, I have
had the case only a week.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Pics
can be found here
http://forums.azbilliards.com/showthread.php?t=251760</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">OK
so the process took awhile, I went through Roy Malott of IndyQ for
the initial order after finding out it could shorten my wait time on
a custom case. Roy was a total gentleman and professional to deal
with also with some great case ideas. I would totally recommend Roy
and his business.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
did the initial order with the help of John Bartons very
comprehensive order site. Then over the next few weeks I made some
changes with the help of Roy. John and Karen then contacted me with a
start date the waiting began. When the start date arrived I had had
some new ideas and put them to John and Karen. I was amazed at how
gracious they were to accommodate me after they had started the case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Over
the next few weeks we found that his team was having a problem with
one of my requests, undaunted John worked very hard in getting
through this and getting it perfect. He also did a few touches I
didn't think of that also are fabulous.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">OK
so the case finally arrived it was like Christmas myself and my cues
were very excited to finally see the finished case. I had seen many
pics during the process. I can only say they did not do it justice.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case came very well packaged took me awhile to open. Inside</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">the
box and bubble wrap was a very nice soft cloth bag covering my case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">When
I took out the case for the first time I was very happy. I then
thought hey i'm a pessimist something is probably wrong. I checked
the bag over with a fine tooth comb. Well i was very wrong, John and
his team hit this out of the park. Every stitch perfect, no spelling
errors everything exactly as I had asked.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">OK
about the case it is mostly a very thick dark brown oil tanned
leather</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">with
antiqued vegetable tan leather for the pockets and the window on the
back.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
lid closure, chalk pocket, Joint protector pocket and personal pocket
all close by magnet. The personal pocket also has two side zippers
what a great idea.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
big bottom pocket has a zipper in the front and one one the side for
a jump handle.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
hardware on the case is antique brass. All hand stitched in brown.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
inside is John's lovable hug, Oh and I put the cues in turned it
upside down shook it and nothing came out. No false advertising
there. The cues do not touch each other and are very happy in there
new home.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">So
far everyone who has seen it loves it especially the art work.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I

and Karen thank you so much for everything as well as putting up with
me during the process. Also tell your team thanks very much.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">when
it comes to the interiors johns (jb) will keep the cue snug in the

and left in my car well when i got home i took my case out of the
trunk and made my way across the driveway and into the house. Well
when i went to set my case down i noticed i had put the strap over my
shoulder upside down meaning my case was upside down and i had not
zipped up my case when putting my cues away well because of my jb
case all my cues stayed in the case instead of boucing around my
driveway and if i had any other interior that night i would have been
up for some costly repairs.</font></p>

Country) Phenomenal Case............ - 01-31-2010, 11:01 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would have responded to this thread earlier, but was at DCC where I
proceeded to get really ill. It turned out to be a crazy virus that
wanted to do some wild dances on my insides for a couple of days,
followed by some lumbar screaming for a couple of days, but I am now
home and on the mend.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case is simply phenomenal. The tooling seems to fit the case
perfectly in its design layout, both the tooling and case
construction are flawless in execution, and overall the case is
likely one of the best cases ever made. (The Palace Garden may still
own that description). As you can tell, I could not be more pleased.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
way the lid snap is reinforced by shaping of the leather is really,
really a good idea and also adds to the look. The upper pouch has a
magnetic clasp which is fitted and recessed in a very unique way. I
hope you have a picture of the upper pouch open to show this
innovative feature. The upper pouch also has a side zipper to
increase ease of use. The tooled handles also add very positively to
the case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
am a happy camper! Please pass my sincere thanks on to all who
contributed with you in building the case. Particularly the tooler!
And I also thoroughly like the fit of the interior to my cues. You
would get a positive kick out of seeing the two cues I have currently
loaded in the case. If I ever start taking pictures, I will be
dangerous.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">BTW,
where can I find one of the cue balls like the one you have in your
pictures? I would like to keep one like it in the ball box (another
wonderful feature of this case, a matching ball box!).</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
is very kind to me by just describing me as patient.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">He
forgot to mention that I am a troublesome customer as well.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Yes,
I am the customer from Singapore who own this cue case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
has been very patient with me despite my extensive demands especially
for the elephant print leather as I wanted this leather badly for the
case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
liked the pockets from the Sterling Wave cue cases and I asked John
if it was possible to install them on my case. He agreed to my
request instantly despite the fact that he has not installed any of
these pockets on his custom cases before.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">He
managed to pull it off almost within 1 week, which I think is quite a
feat as he managed to install and align the pockets to make it look
nice on the case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">In
addition, John used black rivets for this cue case, which makes it
more attractive. Personally I think that that the cue would look loud
if the normal shiny metal or brass rivets are used instead.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">When
I first received the case, I checked the case all over a few times to
check for any minor flaws or imperfection but I could not find any.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Instead
there was a pleasant surprise of a hidden jump cue butt in the long
pockets. It is a small sleeve which really protects the jump cue
butt. John really thinks of everything when it comes to cue
protection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case has everything that I look for in a cue case:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">1.
Good internal and external protection for my cues.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">2.
Simple yet elegant looks.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">3.
Roomy pockets for me to put ALL my accessories into it.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">4.
Comfortable back straps which make it easier for me when I take the
train or buses to pool halls here in Singapore</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">5.
A design which is not too similar to the Flowers style or Instroke
style.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Overall,
I am 100% glad with my purchase and the quality of the case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
feel 100% satisfied and happy for deciding to get a John Barton
Custom case and I think I will get more in the future if my cue
collection expands.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Thank

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Well,
John knocked it out of the park again as far as I'm concerned. I was
really inspired by the case he made for Chris so he made me one. It
is a 3x5 with the secure tubing and has a top pocket for JPs. The
flap on that has a magnet in it for latching. The photos don't really
capture the color of this case unfortunately. It's really a rich dark
brown.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
was VERY easy to work with. He listened and made a couple of changes
with no hesitation. He sent me a bunch of details and pictures along
the way. If you're thinking of using John for a case, don't hesitate
for a minute!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Usually
I get something I've ordered and there are one or two things that bug
me or are done a little sloppy. I can't find one flaw on this case!
The craftsmanship and design are flawless.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">A
long, long time ago in a internet pool forum far, far away John
Barton was involved in a online argument (shocking huh?). Anyhoo at
some point he proclaimed that he was done with the thread and if he
posted in it again he would give me a free case. Why me? I don't know
but he did not post again and the thread died. Months later someone
revived the thread and John, forgeting what he said, posted. Of
course I chimed in with "Woohooo.........free case. Of course
knowing how John is on paying bets (for those around durring the RSB
days you are laughing, if you weren't just trust me that it was funny
and chuckle) I really had no expectations.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Fast
forward to the SBE. I stopped by the booth to see John as I always do
and was given this great leather case. It has a good mix of rugged

of course the interior is very plush and holds the cues snug.</font></p>

- 12-18-2011, 06:24 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
NEW JB Cases arrived a little over a week ago, and ”Arizona” is
what John Barton named this hybrid version of his "All Paul",
inspired type Pool Cue Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
Arizona Pool Cue Case is either 2 Butts x 5 Shafts, or 3 Butts x 4
Shafts configuration, it has a Zippered Jump Butt Compartment, and
also a Jump Butt Protective Sleeve for added protection incorporated
in the Pool Cue Cases 18” Long Lower Pocket.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">That
Long Lower Pocket has John’s SUPER NEATO “L” Shaped Zipper for
ease of access to the Long Lower Pocket, so you do not need a set of
surgeon’s forceps to grab the items from the inside depths of the
Long Lower Pocket with the “L” Shaped Zipper, as your hands will
fit just fine with easy of access, and the Long Lower Pocket Pocket
holds my 16” John Hager Extension with no problems.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Arizona Pool Cue Case was ordered with John’s UltraPadTM Interior
so each Cue Butt, &amp; Cue Shaft Section fits snugly &amp; safely
like a baby wrapped in a receiving blanket. Giving each Cue Butt &amp;
Shaft Section great protection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Up
top there is an 8” Upper Pocket with a built in Chalk/Joint
Protector Holder, that Upper Pocket also incorporates a Zippers
running in a semi circle around the upper portion Pocket for easy
access to the entire storage area. The Pool Cue Case’s Top Closure
is a Barton Puzzle Latch magnetic type closure with no moving part to
break on the Main/Top Cue access closure.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
did ask John to make the Pool Cue Case’s (2) POCKETS a extra 3/8”
deeper than his normal depth of 1-1/4” deep pockets, and that extra
depth worked out just great for storing a couple of “thick” items
I carry, like my Pro-Just-A -Bridge creating no strain, or puffiness
on the pockets.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Pool Cue Case weighs in at a lean 6 Pounds, 2.0 Ounces including the
detachable towel ring that weigh almost 1.5 Ounces by itself. No I
have no weighted the Case full with 2 Butts x 4 Shafts, and the junk
I seem to always put in my Pool Cue Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Pool Cue Case’s bottom features what I like to call the “Barton
Non Slip Foot”, or AKA The Big Rubber Foot on it, so the Pool Cue
Case don't Slip on floor like tile, formica, or some slippery floors
when leaned against a wall in a Pool Room/Sports Bar/Bar.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
and I went back &amp; forth on design, elements &amp; features I
wanted in this Pool Cue Case. I wanted simple tooling design, not a
lot of flash carving, so in the end hand colored contrasting colors
&amp;
creative stamp tooling design by Karen, John’s wife was the answer.
Some stippling tooling to fill empty leather spaces was incorporated
for contrast. The Pool Cue Cases body leather color was dyed a dark
dark brown with some leather grain still showing character, and I
think the Pool Cue Case all came together well, and the look turned
out great IMHO.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">One
of the features I wanted was the Pool Cue Case’s Side &amp; Top
Handles to lay flat when not in use like several of the other Pool
Cue Cases on John's Web-site, and that idea was incorporated as easy
as 1, 2, 3, and worked out really cool.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John’s
Non Slip Shoulder Pad design rocks , as it don’t slip off your
shoulder, dig into your shoulder causing pain, don’t harm the
clothing you are wearing, and that Non Slip Shoulder Pad could not
work any better on a long walks carrying weight.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
honestly think John, and his Team have hit another Home Run out of
the Ballpark with the Arizona Pool Cue Case, and I am one happy
customer. John and his team of craftsmen &amp; women pulled off
another great project per my wishes. Honestly I think John, and his
team’s craftsman's construction, and attention to detail could not
be any better.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
other day I took the Pool Cue Case over to be seen by the people that
belong to our community leather working club. They always get to see
my JB Cases as I respect their opinion, criticism, and compliments,
and everyone gave JBCase’s work nothing but a lot of compliments. A
few of the members have 20 or more years of leather working
experience, critical eyes that know great from only good, or fair, or
marginal leather work. All that I heard from these people was
compliments on John’s &amp; his Team attention to details after a
few of the members gave the Pool Cue Case a very close inspection
both inside, and out. Checking out how the pockets were constructed,
the “L” Zipper, Stitching, etc. The overall opinion of John &amp;
his Teams works was they are execution, and producing a very very
high quality of leather working.</font></p>

is what Roberto had to say about the cases.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">"John,</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
just got home from vacation today and the first thing I did when I
got home was open the package you sent me. Wow ! What a great way to
start the new year.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I'm
very impressed with the attention to detail; Not only of the design
of the two cases but how it was shipped. The packaging was
phenomenal, I was shocked to see color coded suede covers for each
pool case - Nice touch. The suede covers made me feel like I was at a
show where I had to unveil the curtain before I was able to see the
work of art. Trust me when I say that I felt like a little kid on
Christmas day opening presents.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Despite
seeing the pictures you sent me and the You tube Video ( very nice of
you to do, by the way) of the two cases before receiving them, I was
still stunned of the craftsmanship that went into the making these
two gorgeous cases. You were right, the pictures that you sent me on
the cases does no justice. The tooling on the leather jumps right out
at you. Each time I look at the lacing on my case I think of Karen's
hands and fingers - please send her my thanks, I know that was hard
to do. The basket weave on my cases line's up perfectly and despite
having reservations on the size of the shield on the back of my case
I think it came out awesome, Exactly what I wanted.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
love how you took my brother (Mario) and my ideas and translated them
to make this work of art. You and your team are true professionals
and are the top of your field when it comes to leather work and cue
protection of pool cases. I'm very happy to have your name and zhen
Hai names associated and showcased with brothers and my case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
only disapproval I have is I wish you would have sent me more
business cards because I feel I will run out of them very fast.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
wish you and your family a prosperous new year.</font></p>

first John Barton - 11-23-2010, 01:33 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I've
had cases by Swift, and Justis, but this is my first Barton. I'm used
to the tube style, so going to a soft butterfly was new for me. Also,
I've never dealt with John before, and have only seen his posts on
AZ.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">From
the beginning, John was not only quick to reply, but courteous and
very easy to deal with. Shipping was only two days from China, and
the quality of the work is superb. Packed well for the trip, it also
arrived in a velvet-like soft case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
loved the colour (dark cognac), but I was wondering about it being
vinyl and not leather. John posted a clear explanation that this
wasn't leather, but the pics really looked great. Well, I understand
how they could be confused, as the colouration, and texture are
wildly similar.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
was concerned about the protection with a soft padded butterfly.
However, so far cues all feel snug, and well protected in the
interior. Case is also well built, and all the seams and straps are
quite strong.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Overall,
a big thumbs up, and thanks again John for the great service!</font></p>

New JB 3x5 Tube Style - 04-07-2010, 09:49 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have been saving for this case ever since I fell in love with it at
the WCCS. Now it's finally here! It's a JB 3x5 tube style. Not that I
don't like JB's ultra pad but you just can't beat tubes imho and
John's work on this case is just incredible. Very very solid
construction and the Leather is ultra thick and butter soft to the
touch. I am not much of a tooling guy. I just wanted a nice smooth
clean case and this is it. This will be my new player's case and
should last me the rest of my playing years. It has some weight to it
but that is ok by me because I'm a big guy and i'll take a little
weight for the ultra protection this will give my cues. Thank you
John Barton for making this incredible case.</font></p>

first want to say thank you JB for completing yet another work of
art. I would also like to thank you for listening to me and creating
the exact case I was looking for.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">As
most of you know I am a "simple" guy. I believe less is
definately better. This case is nowhere near as fancy as some John
has created but for me it is absolutely perfect. I love the clean,
simple, classic look. I feel very fortunate to own such a fine case
to house my cues. I am sure the Gus will fit nice and snug.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Too
bad I will not be seeing the case in person as I cannot make it to
the Expo this year which really pisses me off. But, knowing this and
other things will be waiting for me upon my return home next year
will definately motivate me to get through this year.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
use it a lot, buddy. It's an awesome case, exactly what I asked for.
I asked John to make me a 1x2 the way he wanted to. All I wanted was
the small pocket. I didn't ask for any specific leather or color. And
I never nagged at him. When he gave me the case I was blown away. He
picked leather as carefully as I pick wood. Perfect case for me.
Natural leather, no stain or special adornment, simple design, and
just enough flare to make it classy. Thanks, John.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
received my 2x4/3x4 configured Sterling 'Wave' case shortly after the
New Year...and when UPS decided to finally dig it out of one of their
trailers after our PNW 'Arctic Blast'. I have had a little over a
month or so to get acquainted with it...and gotta say, I am pretty
pleased with this case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
requested the black/brown 'tooled' vinyl version of this case. The
vinyl is different than the Skai vinyl that was used on John's
Instroke Premier line....but still appears to be VERY durable. I have
been just tossing this case into the back seat or trunk of my car,
and no visible scuff marks and/or tears that I have noticed. It does
look like a tooled leather case. Good stuff, and I have received many
compliments on it.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case also comes with padded, ergonomically-shaped dual backpack
straps on the back, which are easily removable for when you just do
not need them. I did notice that the placement of the bottom ring for
the straps is such that it should not get accidently snapped off when
the straps are not in place...good forethought here.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case has what I would call a 'flatter' profile, and as a result, what
the double pockets on front lack in depth, they make up for in width,
and I have yet to fill either pocket all the way up with
'stuff'...LoL. The case features self-healing zippers, and I have
experienced no problems with them whatsoever, and I am in and out of
both the case itself and especially the pockets all the time.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Now
as to the interior...this case looks inside very much like that of
John's higher-end cases, and is quite 'cushy'. It also features the
Organic Rebound system that John came up with. What this means is
that when you open the case, the butts and shafts 'pop' up for easier
access. No tipping the case upside down or digging in to retrieve
either butts or shafts. I selected the 2x4/3x4 configured case. John
has managed to figure out where the wasted space in the traditional
2x4 config was, and he utilized it to offer the option of carrying an
additional butt. So, basically, you could carry one butt and two
shafts, and then one butt, one shaft, one butt, one shaft....or two
players and a J/B.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
stitching on this case is terrific, as I would have expected from a
case that John had a hand in...and the 'Wave' design is both
interesting and unique. As I have previously stated....I get lot's of
compliments on this case every time I take it out. The case is also
relatively lightweight, which is why I have been using it exclusively
since I got it. In the past I have not usually carried all of my cues
with me because I just didn't care for carrying all that weight. The
handle on the case is round and quite comfortable for carrying.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would have to say that all in all...I am pretty happy with this case.
I think it provides a great option for those who either cannot afford
a higher-end case, or just do not wish to carry one on a daily basis.
In other words, you are getting all the important benefits of John's
higher-end cases, but without the cost of a custom case. A definite
recommendation from me!!</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">How
about a case review? - 02-01-2009, 12:38 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
is a 4x8 Sterling case with the new JB interior.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Exterior:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Vinyl quality is nice, not as nice as the Instroke Premier but for
the price ($90 for a 4x8 not including shipment and taxes) it is very
nice.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
long pouch does not have a side compartment for a jump cue handle
which is a shame because I doubt if having it would have made this
case more then $2 more expansive to build.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
you must carry a jump cue then it'll fit nicely inside the long
pouch, even with a joint protector, so you can roll it a hand towel
to protect it and you're good to go.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Both
pouches are high enough to accommodate a pool ball with no problems.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
zippers are running smoothly and since they are made of some kind of
soft plastic, it will probably not hurt the cues.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
strap and handle are the same cheap ones that we've seen on Sterling
and other cheap cases in the past, but really for $90 you can't ask
for more. For me, it's not a big deal as this case will not leave the
house and will be used for storage only.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Interior:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
dividers look thick and cushy... something that I haven't seen on any
other 4x8 tubeless cases before. This spec is what made me want this
case. Well the sad news is that the dividers are only that thick for
about 2 inches.... after that it is a thin divider (still protective
but thin)... I guess there is no way 4 butts and 8 shafts would have
fitted in there if the dividers would have been thick all the way
down.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
case comes with that "Organic Rebound interior" which I
believe (correct me if I'm wrong here John) is simply due the the
fact that the compartments that hold the cue parts is a shorter
elastic "sock" so it is stretched when a butt or shaft is
inserted but jumps right back up. I guess if the dividers were thick
all the way down you could not create that "pop up" effect.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">4
butts and 8 shafts do fit in it BUT its very crowded, too crowded if
you ask me, the fit is very tight and I doubt if I'll hold 4 butts
and 8 shafts in it on a constant base, I'll probably hold in it 2 to
3 butts and about 6 shaft. (Unless I'll win more raffles and won't
have any more "cue space" )</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Bottom line:</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">For
$90 (even for $150) it is the best 4x8 case that you can get.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would rather have it a bit bigger so cues will be more "relaxed"
and have the thick dividers go all the way down.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would also prefer not to have that "pop up" feature, so the
cue parts won't stick out for about an inch into the open space of
the lid.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">But
for my current needs as a storage case and mostly for shafts then it
fits me just right!!!</font></p>

3X6 Review - 04-30-2009, 06:52 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
just received this case yesterday so I dont know how it will hold up
or last, but I think it is well made so it should do just fine in
that department.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case I bought came with their new interior with the Organic Rebound
feature. I have to say I really like it. All cues fit bumper down and
all cues fit with JPs; plenty of room. Two nice ample zipper pockets
on the front. Shoulder strap and a padded handle in the middle
between the front pockets. If I had to nit-pick and find one
negative; it would be that the zippers on the cue compartment are
very tight. But there are two zippers, so it isnt that bad.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">All
in all I am very satisfied with this case and would recommend it to
others.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
is one nice case for the money. It looks great and is quite light for
the size of the case. I bought the 4 x 8 to put less cues in and
still have a little elbow room in the case and it has turned out to
be perfect for my purposes with the exception that there is no pocket
for my jump butt. If I put the butt into the large pocket it has to
go in that nice roomy space all by itself unless I want to risk
damage to it. Other than that it's a winner in my opinion.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
love the 3x6 I have. Great case for a very very reasonable price.
Very sturdy case, I have a It's George-V case (2x4) and I would pick
the sterling over it anyday. As a matter of fact, I don't even use
the It's George case lol. It has a very sturdy exterior, the vinyl is
a bit thin and can rip easy compare to real leather. The padding and
protection is great! One of my zippers broke, but just never got a
chance to ship the case back to Sterling for repair or replacement.
The compartments for accessories are huge and can hold almost
everything you want to bring along. Great case!</font></p>

Wave case review - 04-22-2009, 04:22 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
Sterling Wave Case Review</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Recently,
I was fortunate to win a Sterling Wave case from John Barton in his
generous contest. All that was asked in return was an honest review,
so here it is. I’ve never owned a true custom case. They have all
been production models, up to and including an Instroke, so consider
my experience when you read my opinions. The model is the Black and
Tan embossed style, which is designed for a 3x4 or 2x5 configuration.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Interior
features: I’ll start here (and be a little wordy) because IMO that
should be the buyer’s primary concern when purchasing a case. The
Wave uses a system of firm but flexible soft tubes. The dividers flex
easily, but do not compress enough to allow components in adjacent
tubes to come in contact. I decided to use a “joint-down”
configuration to keep chalk out of the tubes. I use joint protectors
100%, and I made sure my j/p’s had rounded edges so that no tube
material would be snagged during insertion or removal. The underside
of the lid is covered in the same vinyl material as the outside, so
chalk residue from the tips is easily wiped clean. Because of the
snug configuration, when fully loaded, you need to remove a butt
first before removing a shaft when the joint-down configuration is
used. I assume it would be the opposite if you stocked it joints-up.
At anything less than a full capacity load, the tubes give enough
that you can load or unload without regard to any sequence. Also, for
those who stand up assembled cues in their case while playing, no
problem, since space is only an issue when fully loaded. I don’t
consider using a loading/unloading routine to be a detriment at all.
Actually, I feel more comfortable with the snug fit than having
components bouncing around in a hard tube.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Unlike
many other cases with a zipper lid, the zipper teeth are set lower
than the case rim, so you’ll never drag a shaft or butt over the
teeth-definitely cool. The interior material is of a texture that is
neither slippery nor clingy. If you accidentally pick up the case
with the lid open, your shafts and butts won’t come flying out. The
interior is equipped with an “organic rebound” system that
provides some natural spring action inside the tubes. You can
actually give the case a shake when opened, and all the components
will rise up slightly. I’ve not found this necessary, as all
components are easy to access and grip, even with a full 3x4 load. In
that respect it’s better than an Instroke 2x4, since the shafts sit
considerably lower than the butts in the Instroke. All in all, the
interior is the absolute best I have ever seen in any case,
regardless of price. Cues are held snug but not tight in all
directions, well padded, and the shell feels fairly stiff, especially
for the empty weight of under 4 lbs, so I’m pretty confident of the
Wave’s level of protection, though I hope never to test it.
Definitely an A+++ grade IMO for the interior.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Exterior
features: Despite its large capacity, this case is slim, only 2 5/8”
X 5 3/8”, not including pockets or handle. There is no top handle,
but the trim size makes it easy to grab from the top. The side handle
is a pre-formed soft material, balanced well, definitely the most
comfortable handle on any case I’ve had. The Wave is equipped with
two rear-mounted shoulder straps for backpack-type use, but I only
use one. The shoulder pad is very wide and long, with a crescent
shape, and a non-skid texture on the inside. The textured surface
grips your shoulder well, even with only one strap. Feels like it
would be quite comfortable for a long haul, but long-term carrying is
not an issue for me. It’s usually just to and from the car, so the
side handle gets the majority of use. Unlike many other cases, there
are no rings of webbing around the case at the handle or straps,
which I consider to be a glaring sign of a cheap-ass case. Hardware
is all plastic, but seems substantial. Pockets are quite large, about
5X8” for the top, and 5X14” for the lower. The pockets are
actually curved in profile to match the case body, so they appear
slimmer than their actual size. Depth is only about 1 1/8”, not
enough for those who carry their own CB, but more than enough room
for my stuff. There is no separate provision for a jump butt, but
plenty of room. I guess you can’t have everything when you’re
trying to keep costs reasonable. The pocket zippers encircle three
sides, and are very smooth. Lid zipper is not so smooth, as it binds
around the tighter curve of the case sides. A minor annoyance, but
hopefully it will loosen up with more use. There are no feet on the
bottom, but the material is the same non-slip texture as the inside
of the strap.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Appearance:
I left this section for last, since it’s purely personal opinion
rather than evaluation. The Wave is obviously designed in a modern,
non-traditional style, with some attention-grabbing contrast in
colors. Frankly it’s a little wild for my AARP-age taste, but might
be fine for yours. My black / tan model has a stamped embossed
pattern throughout, which makes it look and feel cheaper IMO. A
softer-texture, more leather-like vinyl would suit me just fine. The
seam where the tan and black materials meet has some pronounced
ridges rather than a flat, even seam. Hopefully, this was just an
early production flaw that got through QC inspection. Color and
material aside, the Wave has a sleek, trim appearance, much more
appealing to my eyes than the boxy cases on the market. It’s
definitely not your grandfather’s cue case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Overall:
If you made through this lengthy dissertation, you’re likely
considering purchase of a Wave. IMO it’s a simple decision. The
only “If’ in the deal is the looks. Find a color combination that
suits your preferences, and it should be a done deal. With only minor
exceptions, the features, protection qualities and ergonomics should
put this case at the top of anyone’s shopping list. It’s that
good. After only three months I’m spoiled. If I could build my own
dream case, I’d take my Wave; replace the exterior vinyl with
buffalo-style leather and the plastic hardware with brass. I better
start saving up $$ now. My next case is gonna be expensive.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
1st wave case was a 3x6 Orange-Black model which was part of the
early batch that was released mid last year during the BCA Expo. When
I got it, I quickly sold my Instroke Buffalo because, feature-wise,
it surpasses the Instroke, IMO. It's a lot lighter and more compact
than an Instroke of the same capacity (mine was just a few mm ticker
than an Instroke 2x4 but has almost the same width). I've gotten it
for almost a year now and I still haven't had any problems with it...
It's also quite a head-turner if I may add</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Late
last year, I needed more room for my other cues, and since I normally
take 3 cues with me, I opted for another wave case with the 3x4
configuration. The new wave cases have improved a lot from the 1st
batch: pockets are now padded, the lid &amp; the cap shut completely
thanks to the lined-protruding part of the case's shell thereby
sealing the cues from more moisture &amp; climatic changes (a feature
in which most zippered-lid cases fail, imo), the cap and the handle
are now padded, the straps are really ergonomic &amp; comfortable,
the base still has the non-slip material and but sealed better.
Moreover, I tried soaking the pocket with water to see if it's
water-proof. Although mine got soaked, perhaps due to the nature of
the linen that was used on mine, the water didn't penetrate through
the other side of the pocket even after several minutes of trials.
The linen rejected the excess water after reaching its soaking point.
Perhaps John Barton can confirm if the new Wave Cases are water-proof
or water-resistant</font></p>

patience to look for them.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Going
back to the question: what do I think of it? For me, the wave case is
one the best everyday case available. I've sold all my Instrokes and
Predator case and gotten these instead because I'm so happy with
their features especially when it comes to cue protection. These are
the ones that I'll use until I'm finally ready to place an order for
my very own custom case by JB.</font></p>

Wave Case Review - 04-27-2010, 11:48 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Okay,
so maybe this should be in the product review section, but let's face
it, that gets like seven hits a day. I want people to actually read
this review.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
got my Sterling Wave 4x8 case today, and my first impressions have
exceeded my expectations. I'll start with the outside, and we can
work our way in. First of all, the overall appearance of the case is
quite nice. I purchased the blue and black, and I am very pleased.
It's got two shoulder straps so the case can be carried backpack
style, and they're both very comfortable and sturdy. Time will tell
whether or not I keep both straps, as I may only need one, but if I
were to decide I didn't want both, I could simply take one off, as
they are removable.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">There
is a handle on the side of the case as well, and again, it's very
sturdy, but more surprisingly, it's quite comfortable. My old case
has a nylon strap handle that's got a rubber/plastic-type coating on
it, which makes it somewhat uncomfortable to carry.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
know there were zipper issues with the older models, and I know they
have since been fixed. With that said, all of the zippers on my case
work just fine and seem to be of very high quality. The zipper pulls
are oversized, (probably close to 1-1/2" long), which is a
welcome sight. Too often pulls tend to be too small, and this is just
one of the many minor details that was not overlooked.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">There
are two pockets on the front of the case for storage. The first, near
the top, is the accessory pocket. It's generously sized at 7-1/2"x5"
and the BEST part about it is the zipper. It actually unzips almost
all the way down the entire length of the pocket. There's nothing
worse than a nice, big pocket that only unzips a few inches and
leaves you digging around in blindness looking for a cube of chalk or
your tip tool. With the Wave, you can basically unzip it and fold the
pocket all the way down. Again, another detail that was carefully
considered. The bottom pocket is also a great size, coming in at
15"x5". As with the smaller pocket, it zips almost the
entire way down. It's got a super soft, cushioned mesh sleeve on the
inside to hold a jump cue butt, and I EASILY fit in a box of 12
Master chalk, a box of 2 Blue Diamond chalk, a towel, some old tip
tools, and my jump cue butt with plenty of storage to spare.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Onto
the inside. From what I understand, the interior was designed by John
Barton of JB Cases, and he did a PHENOMENAL job. Both the cue butts
and shafts fit snug, but don't need to be forced down into the case.
They simply slide in, and with a light push with one finger, they
find their home. They are completely protected from movement, and the
soft padding almost forms to the shape of the cue. The first test I
put it to was this: I put one shaft in the case, nothing else. I
turned the case upside down, and the shaft didn't move. That is
evidence of how well the interior supports the cues. Then I put all
of my cues in, three butts and five shafts, and not one of them was
difficult to get in or out. And again, they didn't fall out when I
turned the case upside down. Incredible.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">This
case truly is a fantastic piece of equipment. I very highly recommend
it to any and all seeking an appealing case that will protect their
investments to the fullest extent. One of the best parts about this
case, though, is the price point. It is extremely affordable. This
4x8 case was $150. The 2x5/3x4 goes for $135 I believe. At that
price, you won't find a better deal.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have just bought a Sterling Wave (I got the 4x8) and I could not be
happier, its as good as I have seen anywhere. The thing I liked most
about it is the inside protection, it's the same as many Instroke
Cases, it should be good it was designed in conjunction with John
Barton! The pockets are as big as you will ever need, but again
security of my cues was the most important. I spent several weeks
researching and comparing cases and for the money this is truly an
outstanding value. You will find other posts on AZ about them and I
have yet to see a bad review.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have the Black and Brown 4x8 and pictures don't do it justice and
although not a true soft case it's kind of a hybrid.</font></p>

have to say it looks a lot better than what I was expecting.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case is like half the weight of my old one.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
do like the interior. I have not tried to completey fill this thing
yet. But I presume this going to handle as advertized.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">It
said that it can take 31.5" butt. I don't know about that yet.
However I have 31" butt on order so I will find out if that is
true or not.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
like the size of the pockets. both top &amp; bottom.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">IMO
you have a nice size pockets when you measure width x height. However
there is not enough material on th sides that would actually give
these pockets the volume that I had expected. Yes there is the jump
sleeve. I like that. I just think there could be another 1/4" or
1/2" material there to allo more space for all of the junk I
carry around</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Otherwise,
I think theses pockets are fine for the normal user.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Finally,
the straps seems comfortable. Not sure if I would ever use both of
them at once like a back pack.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
got my 3x4 today and it looks great. Its well above my 2x2 case. The
pockets are nice and big and open more fully than other cases. It
seems a little cramped for 2 cues and an extendable bridge shaft. It
all fit, but its pretty tight in there. I would eventually like to
fit another shaft in which it is supposed to handle, but I may have
to upgrade to the 4x8 just to hold what this one should.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">After
a 12 month wait (for a black one), I finally got my Sterling Wave 4x8
case a little over a week ago. It's everything I was hoping it would
be. Got mine for $137.00 because the distributor thought I deserved a
discount for waithing so long for it . I have a Jacoby custom butt
that I ordered that was to be 31" in length, but if you measure
it from the tip of the buttcap to the tip of the pin, it measures 32
3/16" long. It fits in my Wave case, but not with a j/p on it.
Puts a small indention in the inside of the lid, but what the heck,
at least it goes in!!! I had no problems getting 4 butts/8 shafts
into it, but then I watched the video of John showing us how to load
the case. Great case, especially for the $$$.</font></p>

2x4 hard cue case - 12-21-2009, 12:58 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Recently
purchased this case from sterling and I must say it is definitely the
most economical and best protection for the dollar of any case on the
market. I had originally planned to buy a knockoff for $120 more but
changed my mind at the last minute and I'm so glad I did. This case
is very well made and has everything I needed, including pocket room
and light weight. It features Barton's cushioned dividers and organic
rebound which keep your cues snug and secure without being too tight.
Customer service has been excellent as well and overall I am very
happy with my purchase.</font></p>

Barton Tough Love Series Case - 09-10-2011, 09:41 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
and I had been talking about a case about a year and a half ago now,
I think. While I love the fact that he offers so many options, it
also can make it difficult to choose when it comes time to
order...LoL! I told him all the little details about his cases that I
just loved, and would love to see in a case I owned...the result is
this case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Where
to begin? Let's start with that this case is in the 2x5/3x4
configuration...which I think is brilliant...so flexible in a space
occupied typically by a 2x4 case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
leather used in this case is a rich dark brown oil-tanned
leather....which I think is perfect for an every day carry case.
Oil-tanned leather just lends itself to the normal scuffing and such
that would occur over time and use. Many can be simply rubbed away
with the hand...or left alone, to add character. Smells really good
too!</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
case lid is a side opening, and secured with antiqued brass hardware,
and is sturdy. The top handle is nice and comfy to carry, and again,
very sturdy.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Another
nice touch is, instead of scallops and studs...this case's styling is
simpler straight lines and lacing, which I think gives the case a
quiet elegance. I also love that John went the extra mile and
included keeper straps the bind the very well crafted and sturdy
luggage handle and the shoulder strap and padded pad together. Just
another nice touch.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
puzzle latch is simple and effective, although obviously labor
intensive...there is absolutely no worries about failure, as you can
feel that it is handling the weight load quite easily.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Another
feature of this case that I love, and again, is so simple but
effective is the non-skid rubber bottom. No more feet to worry about
snapping off, and the case stays put. No more worrying about the case
sliding down the wall.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">So,
everything that I have mentioned and featured above, is standard to
John's Tough Love Series cases. I don't think he could have more
appropriately named this series of cases. They are tough. As I have
previously stated, all the hardware is an antiqued brass. Stitching
is top-notch throughout...I mean really, especially when the
thickness of the leather is taken into consideration. The UltraPad
Interior is everything John and others have said it is...almost makes
you wish you were a cue...LoL! There is no where that I have found on
this case where a corner was cut to save a buck...no where. From the
minute you pull the case out of it's included protective Ultra-Suede
bag, you know you have something very special in your hands.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Now,
I wanted something a little different, and thought the chalk blue
interior would be cool, and it is.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
had told John one of my pet peeves about case pockets was that the
chalk and my joint protectors always wound up at the bottom of the
pockets. This may well be my most favorite thing on my case...it has
space for a piece of chalk at the ready and space to hold joint
protectors, so they don't fall out.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">If
anyone is interested, the full centerfold spread is here:
http://www.jbcases.com/lisas-future.html</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
would recommend one of John's cases, without a moment of hesitation,
to anyone. Yes, the wait might be on par with that of some high end
custom cue makers (kidding)...but John's cases are worth every minute
of the time you wait to finally receive it. They're just that good.</font></p>

JB Case.... - 01-13-2011, 05:55 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Got
my JB Case in yesterday, and I couldn't have been more pleased. John
and Karen were both very courteous (Even when I was freaking out),
and the case came to me EXACTLY the way I wanted it. I was very
nervous during the entire process, as I felt like it was a
substantial amount of cash for a case. But when I upacked it, I knew
why it costs so much!! It's more like a work of art than a cue case.
It is simply beautiful, and if you want something truly nice, you
have to pay for it. The case is built like a tank, and the leather is
thick and very soft to the touch. All the straps are tough, and the
zippers are heavy duty. I have had 3 less expensive cases, and I
destroyed them. I do not see how I could ever wear the handles,
straps and latches out on this one. Simply put, I love the case, and
I am sure that I will be pleased in the future. Great job
John...another happy customer.</font></p>

Mason TYPE Pool Cue Case - 08-23-2011, 09:34 AM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
NEW Pool Cue Case arrived several weeks ago, and Masonite is what
John Barton named this first ever Mason Type Pool Cue Case with a
Little Extra Reinforcing for added Pool Cue Protection. The Mason
line of Pool Cue Case was inspired by a fly fishing tool case done by
master leather worker Arne Mason.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">What
secret materials John used to give the Pool Cue Case that added
protection up front behind the pockets, and to the rear part of the
Cue Case is unknown, but rumor control has it that John created it,
in his secret laboratoryin hhis work shop where John &amp; his team
of workers do most of the R &amp; D, and tweaking of new ideas for
Pool Cue Cases, and Pool related products John has developed.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
Masonite Pool Cue Case is a 2 Butts x 4 Shafts Configuration, with a
Zippered Jump Butt Compartment, with a Jump Butt Protective Sleeve
for added protection incorporated in the Pool Cue Cases 18” Long
Lower Pocket. That Long Lower Pocket has John’s SUPER NEATO “L”
Shaped Zipper for ease of access, and it holds my 16” John Hager
Extension with no problems. Plus the Masonite Pool Cue Case has
John’s well padded compartments for each Cue Butt Section &amp;
each Cue Shaft Section to fit in snugly like a baby in a receiving
blanket giving each Cue Butt Section &amp; each Cue Shaft Section
great protection.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Plus
there is an 8” Upper Pocket with a built in Chalk/Joint Protector
Holder, the Upper Pocket Incorporates Zippers running down each side
of the Upper Pocket for easy access to the entire storage area, and
uses a Puzzle Latch Closure on the top of the pocket. The Pool Cue
Cases Top closure is also a Puzzle Latch closure on the Main/Top Cue
access area.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
did ask John to make the Pool Cue Case’s (2) POCKETS a 1/4”
deeper than his normal depth of 1-1/4”, and that extra 1/4” more
depth worked out just great for storing a couple of item I carry
creating no strain, or puffiness on the pockets.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">The
Pool Cue Case weighs in at a lean 5 Pounds, 6.0 Ounces including the
detachable towel ring that weigh almost 2.0 Ounces buy it self. No I
have no weighted the Case full with 2 Butts x 4 Shafts, and the junk
I seem to always put in my Pool Cue Case.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John
and I went back and forth on design, &amp; features I wanted as I
wanted in this Pool Cue Case light enough that I could use when I
walk to our Community Pool Room that is about a Mile and a Third walk
each way. So the Pool Cue Case did not beat me up on my trek. But
still offers Great Cue Protection, and easy access, and room for what
I carry beside Pool Cue Butts, and Shafts sections.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Plus
I wanted simple design, no flash, no tooling, just function for what
I wanted to carry, leather dyed a dark dark brown with some leather
grain showing character, and good Pool Cue Protection. Everything I
ask John for, John &amp; his Team delivered, plus more.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">John’s
Non Slip Shoulder Pad design rocks IMHO as it don’t slip off your
shoulder, and don’t harm clothing you are wearing, like my favorite
$100.00 Tommie Bahama Hawaiian Shirts I pick up at a garage sale. The
Non Slip Shoulder Pad could not work any better on a long walks IMHO.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
honestly think John, and his Team have hit a Home Run with the
Masonite Pool Cue Case, I am one happy customer. John and his team of
craftsmen &amp; women pulled off another great project per my wishes,
and honestly I think his team’s craftsmanship, construction, and
attention to detail could not be any better.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">My
New Mason Case 04-14-2012, 08:50 PM</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">I
have had several JB Cases in all forms, including 4x8 butterflies;
his standard cases (Range Rover, Strong Bear, etc.); GTF; and several
Instroke cases from when John was making them. I love them all and
they are all made of excellent quality and protection. I also have
several cases from other manufactures, but thought I'd concentrate on
John's stuff. But my feeling's on the Mason case pretty much hold
true for the rest.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">Although
I haven't used the Mason case all that much so it's still new, I find
the weight, size, pocket size &amp; design, and workmanship/quality
of the leather to be second to none. Although the pockets are a
little more roomy on the 4x8 butterfly because they have more room to
work with because of the larger surface, the added length of the
large pocket on the Mason allows my extender to be fully assembled
when stored, whereas I have to remove the end cap to store it in any
other case I have (I love this feature!).</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-after: avoid;"><font face="Verdana">One
thing to note is that because of its compact design, it is a tight
fit storing my cues in it as it is new and I think the leather and
the inserts need breaking in per John's video so this will get
better. Other than that...I LOVE IT! It looks cool and all that saw
it Friday night love it, too.</font></p>
