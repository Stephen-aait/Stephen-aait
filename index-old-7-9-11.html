            <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial">This is
the Palace Garden.&nbsp;
It is the most ornate case we have made to date.&nbsp; The owner of
this case is a German collector who is a biker that is into
orchids.&nbsp; The reason that this case is called the Palace Garden is
that I chose to do an path of flowers around the case which is not
unlike the gardens in the German palaces.&nbsp; As you&nbsp;turn the
case around you can follow the path and always see different
florals.&nbsp; Click on the case to take your own stroll around the
case.<br>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial">So by
now you have figured out that we make cue cases.&nbsp; Welcome to JB
Cases.<br>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><font face="Arial">My name
is John Barton. I have been a leather cue case maker since 1991. In
1991 I founded<span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">&nbsp;Instroke Cue
Cases. </span></font><font face="Arial">In 2003 I sold my stake in
Instroke and took a break from cue case making to go and work for <a href="http://www.sterling-gaming.com">Sterling Gaming Billiard Supplies</a> . &nbsp;Sterling sent me to China in 2006 and today I work with them to &nbsp;create new cases and other products.</font><font face="Arial"><span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"></span><br>
            <br>
I started out in my attic in 1991 making only one-of-a-kind unique
cases. Each one was
either a creation of my own devising or a collaboration between the
customer's desire and my interpretation of that desire. In this way I
crafted, with my little team, around 200 cases before we moved into
mass
production in 1994.&nbsp; My thoughts however always stayed with all
the unique cases we had created in the beginning.<br>
            <br>
Starting over in May 2007 and thanks to the opportunity provided by
Sterling Gaming, I began taking&nbsp;orders again.&nbsp;
In the past two and a half years we have made around 200 unique cue
cases
from mild to wild.&nbsp; Addtionally we started a new semi-production
line to pay tribute to a cue case pioneers, Jasper "Jay" Flowers and
Nora Van Horn, where we have now passed the 100 case mark. </font><br>

philosophy is p</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">rotection
first.&nbsp;</span></font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> I
started making cases for one simple reason, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="protection.html">protection</a>.</span>
Not just any protection either. Specifically, protection against damage
resulting from your cues coming out of the case when you don't want
them to.&nbsp; In 1990 I had a $1400 Schon Cue that was broken because
my open case
was knocked off the table and the cue shot out of it and broke the butt
cap as it clattered on the floor. That case was a $400 tooled leather
beauty. Top of the line at the time. But it didn't do the one thing I
felt it should and that was to protect my cues until I removed them
from it.<br>
                  <br>
                  </font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold;">A case's function
is&nbsp;first to protect it's contents and second to provide easy
access to it's contents.&nbsp; Following that idea I build cases
where the form follows the function. Another way to look at it is a
center-out approach.&nbsp; Using the cues as the center, I put
several layers of protection around them.</font><br>
                  </p>

                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">What kind of protection am I talking
about?&nbsp; Read about it here in depth, <a href="protection.html">Protection
Matters.</a><br>

                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">Each case has high density foam rubber to
pad against impact
contusions. Each case has layers of insulation to provide some
protection against environmental changes. <br>
                  <br>
Each case is lined with a
non-abrasive and non-moisture absorbing material to protect the finish
from scratches and to help keep the cue dry.&nbsp; <br>
                  <br>
No cue parts
will be allowed to touch each other at any point. Your cue will as
protected as the design you choose allows for.</font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><br>

custom case?</span>&nbsp; </font><br>
                  <font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><br>
A leather custom case is one that is made to your specifications within
the limit of our abilities. &nbsp;</font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">Each
case
we make is absolutely unique. &nbsp;Some case makers will settle on a
particular pattern and all of their cases will be simple variations of
that pattern. &nbsp;This is their look and style. &nbsp;Our style is
that there is not any thing that we won't try. The only thing we
won't do is make an exact copy of one of our case making
colleague's work. &nbsp;Other than that our only limitation is
imagination and resources. <br>
                  </font></p>
                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">Cookie cutter vs. similar models.&nbsp;
Over
time we have found that some customers like the look of certain
patterns we use and to that end we will also build cases using those
patterns
we have developed.&nbsp; So over the past few years we have developed
several categories of cases, not lines, but simply models we named when
we did the first one.&nbsp; Then the next person comes along and says,
"build me one like the Rolls Royce" and we do with a little twist here
and there to keep it fresh and unique.&nbsp; The major difference
between us and many of our colleagues is that we don't charge extra to
change
our patterns around to suit your desire.&nbsp; If it takes us a few
minutes more to make you a longer or higher pocket then it's not a big
deal.&nbsp; We laser cut our parts and we are experts in modifying the
pattern quickly and correctly.<br>
                  </font></p>
                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">For example the
case you see below is an example of a true custom case from start to
finish and was a year in the making from first concept to
finished case.&nbsp; It has many innovative features and custom parts
on it that you absolutely will not find anywhere else.&nbsp; <br>
See more of it here <a href="http://www.jbcases.com/doc.html">Doc's
Case</a><br>
                  </font></p>
                  <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 600px; height: 145px;" alt="" src="http://www.jbcases.com/pic/doc/09.jpg"><br>
                  </div>
                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">This
case is a model called the Chris case which is a great example of a
customer starting with a particular case and adding the things he
wanted: <br>
                  <br>
                  </font></p>
                  <div style="text-align: center;"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="chris.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 600px; height: 217px;" alt="" src="http://www.jbcases.com/cases/chris-web/chris-a-front.jpg"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><br>
                  <font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font></div>
                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">Then along comes Jim Murphy and says he
wants the Chris case but modified to look like this:<br>
                  <br>
                  </font></p>
                  <div style="text-align: center;"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><a href="murphy.html"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 600px; height: 158px;" alt="" src="http://www.jbcases.com/cases/murphyweb/murphy-a-front.jpg"></a></font><br>

                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">So you
can see that we aren't constrained and we are willing to try anything.<br>
                  <br>
                  </span>A new addition to our offerings is the return
of the Butterfly cases.&nbsp; Now we had sold a few butterfly cases
since 2007 but this new crop are the ones I am really proud of as they
are completely redesigned from the interior out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent
several months refining the interior to make it super user friendly and
protective.&nbsp; Without a doubt ours are the very best on the market
at this time.<br>

                  <br>
What else do we do? &nbsp;</span>We
design cue cases for the mass market as well. &nbsp;We spend a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lot</span> of time
researching and developing every aspect of cue cases. &nbsp;Currently
our new interiors and exterior designs are featured on 40 new and
improved models being sold by <a href="http://www.sterling-gaming.com">Sterling
Gaming</a>. &nbsp;We are also proud to say that we were chosen to make
modern versions of the Fellini and Centennial cases, the <a href="http://www.gtfcases.com">GTF cases</a>.
&nbsp;Even if you don't decide on a custom JB Case then there are
plenty of choices out there to benefit from our dedication to cue
protection.<br>
                  <br>
As mentioned above am proud to announce that the creation of the <a href="http://www.jbcases.com/jflowers.html">J.Flowers Line</a>
of cases is going well.&nbsp; Jasper "Jay" &nbsp;Flowers along with case
maker Nora Van Horn were&nbsp;pioneers in
this business. We have created a line to honor their
contribution.&nbsp;
J.EF Q Cases or "Flowers" cases as they were better known inspired many
case makers including myself and Jack Justis Cases.<br>

                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">Where do JB Cases come from?<br>
                  <br>
Well, from my mind to start with, but people who ask this question want
to know what patch of Earth the cases are produced on.&nbsp;  <br>
                  <br>
At
present
I live and work in Xiamen, China.&nbsp;I have built a small
workshop to design and create pool cue cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I
can and do work on every aspect of making cases I prefer to
direct.&nbsp; My talent lies in figuring out new ways to build cue
cases.<br>
                  <br>
My
team consists of
myself as the chief designer, teacher, quality control and marketing
manager, a master tooler who focuses on the tooled and carved designs,
four master seamstresses for all the sewing aspects,&nbsp; two
apprentices
for the tooling and construction and one graphic designer for the
pattern making.&nbsp;
There is almost nothing outside the realm
of possiblilty for us.&nbsp; All in
all we are up to 9 of us who are committed to making the very best in
custom leather cue cases.<br>
                  </font></p>
                  <p class="STYLE4" align="justify"><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">I will do my utmost&nbsp;
to provide the highest level of
protection using the</font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;"> very best materials to fit</font><font id="font_word" style="font-family: Arial;">
your desired design and your stated needs. We won't
be able to do the impossible but we might get close and surprise you
with the results. All I ask in return beyond the price we agree on is
your patience.&nbsp; The actual construction of the case can take
anywhere from a few days to a month.&nbsp; The most time consuming part
however is designing the perfect case.&nbsp; Each customer gets the
same special attention and you can see how having a&nbsp; lot of orders will make it
more difficult to respond to all inquiries quickly. We will get it done
though and it will be worth the wait.<br>
                  <br>
After nearly 20 years in this profession I am proud to say that
myself and my team are ready to make you the case of your dreams. <br>
                  <br>

endorse the <a href="protection.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">relative protectiveness</span></a>of
these brands, with the exception of the ones I am involved
with.&nbsp; I do however feel that all them build solid cue cases worth
owning.&nbsp; If your favorite case maker has been left off the list
then I either don't know them, aren't familiar with their work or
wouldn't use their case myself.<br>

special place for me. He is a
leather artist and casemaker of the highest art.<br>
We collaborated on a few cases while I had Instroke and each one was
beyond compare and sold within one hour of being offered.</font><font face="Arial">&nbsp;
Chas was injured several years ago and that injury all but ended his
leather working career.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can get any work done by Chas you will have a
treasure for life. This entry is more a tribute to his legacy but I hop he can return to work.<br>

Other
new custom cue case makers who are making a name for themselves
with impressive work are Rusty Melton and Marc Turcasso, Rex Goulet and
Del W.&nbsp; None of these makers have
a website yet but when they do I will list them here.&nbsp; You may
also check my gallery where I add pictures of the work of new and old
case makers as I find them.&nbsp; I am a bit of a case historian and
like to collect and discuss information about them.<br>
